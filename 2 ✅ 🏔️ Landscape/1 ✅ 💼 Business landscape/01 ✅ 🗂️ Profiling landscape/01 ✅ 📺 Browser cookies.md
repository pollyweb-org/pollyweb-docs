---

In 2019, the Washington Post (an  American newspaper) published the following video, titled *"This is how Google's Chrome lets the cookies track you, imagined in real life"*.

- The video explains how Google Chrome allows third-party cookies to track users' online activity, building detailed profiles of their interests and habits. 
- The video argues that this tracking is invasive and that users should consider switching to browsers that block third-party cookies by default, such as Firefox or Safari.
