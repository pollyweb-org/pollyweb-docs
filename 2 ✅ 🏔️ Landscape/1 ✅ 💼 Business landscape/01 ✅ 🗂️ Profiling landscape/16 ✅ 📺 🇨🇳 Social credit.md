In 2019, NBC News (a U.S.-based news organization) published the following video, titled *"A Look Inside China’s Social Credit System | NBC News Now"*.

- The video explores China's implementation of a social credit system, which assigns citizens scores based on their behavior. 
- Positive actions, such as community service, can improve one's score, while negative behaviors, like jaywalking or spreading rumors, can decrease it
- Consequences of a low score include travel restrictions and limited access to certain services. 
- The system utilizes advanced surveillance technologies, including facial recognition, to monitor citizens' activities.
