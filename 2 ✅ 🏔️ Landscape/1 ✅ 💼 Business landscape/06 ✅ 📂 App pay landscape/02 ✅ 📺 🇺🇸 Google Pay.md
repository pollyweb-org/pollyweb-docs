---

In the following 2024 video, entitled "Everything you need to know about Google Pay & Wallet", Google explains in depth how their payment services work.

- Google supports payment management via Google Pay and Wallet, aiming for seamless business transactions between buyers and sellers. 
- Android OS supports contactless payments, requiring users to authorize the payments with biometrics after the tap, unless in transit mode. 
- By supporting the commercialization of third-party products on Android Play, Google assumes responsibility over many undifferentiated business processes on behalf of app sellers, including user experience and payments.
