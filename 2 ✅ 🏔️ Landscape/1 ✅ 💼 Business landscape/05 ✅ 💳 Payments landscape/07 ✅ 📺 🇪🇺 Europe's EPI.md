📺 What is the 🇪🇺 European Union doing with payments?
----

The European Payments Initiative (EPI), a unified digital payment service backed by 16 European banks and payment service providers, aims to create a unified, pan-European payment system, reducing reliance on global players like Visa and Mastercard. 

- Its consumer-facing product, Wero, will offer instant payments, a digital wallet, and a card for seamless transactions across the EU. 

- Complementing these, the EU Digital Wallet, expected by 2026, will provide citizens with a secure platform to store digital IDs, official documents, and payment options, potentially integrating with Wero and the Digital Euro. 

- The following 2024 video by Wero, titled *"Wero brand showreel"*, introduces the Wero app.
