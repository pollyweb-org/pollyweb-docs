🧑 What are the challenges that end-users face with payments?
---

Despite significant recent improvements in online and contactless payments, individuals still face daily challenges when paying.

- Payment methods are mostly defined by the business and not by the consumer.

    - An American tourist buying a coffee in a Starbucks in rural China will typically be limited to pay in Chinese Yuan cash, or with a bank card accepted by the UnionPay card network, or via a Chinese payment app like Alipay and WeChat, or via the Chinese version of the Starbucks app.

- Open banking increased the number of apps required to pay with smartphones.

    - When paying for a product in the Temu app with Google Pay, a consumer opens the Google Pay app to select the card, then the bank app to approve the payment, then the SMS app to read the one-time-password, then back, back,... and back.

- Payments are typically disconnected from the transaction record.
    
    - This limits the use of digital accounting solutions to reduce the bureaucratic burden for expense reporting, annual taxes, warranties, and insurances.
    
    - While this disconnection typically exists to avoid tracking users based on their expenditures (e.g., an insurance company could infer a person's illness by mapping pharmacy expenditures to bank card details), it doesn't stop businesses to track user data via membership programs.

- Consumers are limited in their payment options by legislation aimed to protect those same consumers from paying financial fees.

    - Banks typically charge percentage fees to businesses for each customer transaction in a point-of-sale, with the percentage increasing with additional features like contactless and credit, a variable fee depending on the bank of the card owner (e.g., American Express typically charges businesses a higher feed than Visa), and a minimum fee regardless of the total value of the transaction.
    
    - Countries like Brazil and Portugal authorize these fees, but don't authorize businesses to pass those fees to customers (event when customers are willing to do so). 

    - As a result, a number of business in these countries opt not to accept contactless, high-end credit cards (e.g., American Express), foreign debit cards, and card payments under a certain value (e.g., only cash under €5).

    - For a U.S.-based tourist in Portugal, paying in cash forces them to withdraw cash from an ATM (e.g., Euronet), paying withdrawal and Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) fees to the ATM provider, and paying cash advance and foreign transaction fees to the bank that issued the card.
    
    - While percentages very, the fees paid by tourists are invariably much higher than the ones the business saved.
