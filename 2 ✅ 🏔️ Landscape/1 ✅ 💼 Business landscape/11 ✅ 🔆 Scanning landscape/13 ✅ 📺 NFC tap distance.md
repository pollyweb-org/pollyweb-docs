📺 From how far can an NFC tag be tapped?
---

In 2022, Seritag NFC Tags (a UK-based NFC tag provider) published the following video, titled *"NFC Tag Labels Scan/Read Distances Compared"*.

- The video demonstrates the difference in scan strength between various NFC tag sizes. 
- It explains that larger tags generally have a higher scan strength, allowing for greater reading distances from the phone. 
- The video uses three different tag sizes to illustrate this point.
