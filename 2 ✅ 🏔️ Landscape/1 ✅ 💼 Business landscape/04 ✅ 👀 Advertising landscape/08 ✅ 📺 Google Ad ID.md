- The video is about Google's 2013 plan to stop using cookies to track web users. 
- The video discusses the concerns about privacy that cookies raise, as well as the potential benefits of Google's proposed alternative, which would use a single identifier to track users across the web. 
- The video also discusses the potential drawbacks of Google's plan, such as the possibility that it could give Google too much power over the advertising market.
