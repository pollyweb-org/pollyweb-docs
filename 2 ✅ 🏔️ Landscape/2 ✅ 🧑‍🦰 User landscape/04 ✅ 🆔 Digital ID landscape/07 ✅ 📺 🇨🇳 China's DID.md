📺 What is 🇨🇳 China doing around digital identity?
---

China has implemented extensive ubiquitous face recognition for its citizens, from public spaces like airports to entrances into residential buildings.

- In August 2024, China launched a trial of its national digital identity system across 81 apps. This digital ID, integrated into platforms like WeChat and Alipay, allows Chinese citizens to access services such as hotel check-ins, banking, and more by scanning a code on their smartphones.

- Since 2016, Chinese users have been using a SIM-based authentication via China Mobile, as described in the following video titled *"Digital identity management with China Mobile authentication"*.
