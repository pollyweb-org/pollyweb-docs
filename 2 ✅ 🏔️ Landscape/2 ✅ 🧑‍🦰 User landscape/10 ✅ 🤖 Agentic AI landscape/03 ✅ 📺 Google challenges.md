---

In 2018, Google for Developers published a video titled *"Keynote (Google I/O '18)"*.

- The following video part demonstrates Google Assistant's ability to make a phone call book a restaurant, and how it managed an unexpected situation.
- According to the video, Google used this technology to automatically call businesses and ask them if they were going to open during holidays.
- The open/close confirmation is what fuels that information on Google Maps.
