📺 How to remove PII indexes from Google Search results?
--

In 2023, KTLA 5 (a American television station) published the following video, titled *"Google launched a new tool to delete your personal info - Here's how!"*.

- This video is about Google's tool called "Results About You".
- This tool allows users to remove personal contact information like phone numbers and addresses from Google search results. 
- However, Google's tool doesn't remove that information from the sites where the data was taken from, so the same information can appear on other search engines.
