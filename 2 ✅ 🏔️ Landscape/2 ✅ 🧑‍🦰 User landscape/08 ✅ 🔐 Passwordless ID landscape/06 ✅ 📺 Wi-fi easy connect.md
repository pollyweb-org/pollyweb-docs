📺 What is the 🛜 Wi-Fi Alliance doing with passwordless authentication?
---

In 2021, the Wi-Fi Alliance released the following video, titled *"Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Easy Connect: simple, secure connections"*.

- The video introduces Wi-Fi Easy Connect, a protocol to add Wi-Fi devices with limited or no display interface (such as smart doorbells, light bulbs, or smoke detectors) to both Wi-Fi networks. 
- Wi-Fi Easy Connect enables onboarding and configuration either via zero touch cloud-based technology, or by Near Field Communication (NFC).
- It aims to replace the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) passwordless protocol, which is considered susceptible to brute-force attacks.
