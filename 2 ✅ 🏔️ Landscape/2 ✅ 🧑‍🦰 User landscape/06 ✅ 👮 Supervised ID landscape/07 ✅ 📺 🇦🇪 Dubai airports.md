📺 What is 🇦🇪 Dubai doing with ID verification at airports?
---

The following video, titled *"Biometric self-boarding at Dubai Airport"*, was released in 2021 by Gulf News.

- The system is based on iris scans and face recognition. 
- Similar to [Amazon One](https://one.amazon.com/), iris scanners can uniquely identify a person globally, so it can be used as the key to identify the person's record - this differs from face scan, where a passport is required to find the person's key and then the face scan is only matched with the picture inside the passport. 
- This means that UAE citizens don't need their passports to enter the country - only their eyes. 
- As of October 2024, the "Travel Without Borders" initiative at the Terminal 3 of Dubai airport allows passengers to check in, pass through immigration, and board their flights without needing physical documents such as passports or boarding passes.
