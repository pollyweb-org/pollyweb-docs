📺 What is the 🇪🇺 European Union doing with cross-border biometrics?
---

In 2024, the European Union (EU) introduced the EU Entry-Exit System (EES), imposing new cross-border rules for non-EU passport holders.
- EES uses facial recognition and fingerprint biometrics to verify identities, replacing passport stamps. 
- Travelers need to register their fingerprint before crossing EU borders for the first time, to associate it with a digital version of their passports.
- The EU stores collected fingerprints for 3 years and limits its access to authorized European and national agencies.

In early 2024, The London Standard released the following video, titled "Date for new Eurostar checks set as fingerprint kiosks built".
- It explains the impact of EES on the London end of the Eurostar train to Paris.
