📺 What is 🇹🇷 Turkey doing with ID verification at airports?
---

In 2019, the Istanbul Airport in Turkey released the following video, entitled "E-Passport System".

- The video explains how travelers can use the special gates for international electronic passports (e-passports) compliant with ICAO's standards.
- The process starts when the gate reads the near-field communication (NFC) chip of the e-passport.
- The traveler then scans their fingerprints while looking at the gate's camera.
