---

In 2023, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the Liveness Check feature for Amazon Rekognition.

- This is a web-based component that records a video using the browser's camera API, examining eye reactions to a sequence of colorful lights before returning the final picture of the user's face to the backend service. 
- The following video, titled *"Validate live users from spoof attacks with Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness"*, shows a demo of the AWS service.
