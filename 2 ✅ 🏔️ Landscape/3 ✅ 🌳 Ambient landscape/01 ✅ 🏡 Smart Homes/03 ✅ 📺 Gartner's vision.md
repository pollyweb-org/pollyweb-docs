---

In 2024, Gartner published the following video, titled *"Top Strategic Tech Trends for 2025 | Live from Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo"*.

- In the video, Gartner envisions that within the next 3 to 7 years, ambient invisible intelligence will integrate ultra-low-cost, small smart tags and sensors into everyday environments, enabling large-scale, affordable tracking and sensing. 
- Key breakthroughs driving adoption include advancements in very low-power wireless technologies, energy harvesting, and low-cost, low-energy electronics.
- Energy harvesting captures ambient energy (solar, thermal, kinetic, RF) to power low-energy devices, enabling sustainable, battery-free operation.
