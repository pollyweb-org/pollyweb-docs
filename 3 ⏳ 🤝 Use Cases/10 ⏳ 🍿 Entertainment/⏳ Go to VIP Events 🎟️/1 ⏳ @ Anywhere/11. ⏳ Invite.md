1. **How to acquire a non-transferable entrance to a venue?**

    A user can tap/scan/click the NFC/QR/link of the event: 
    1. the venue asks for an identity token - the user provides; 
    1. the venue issues a booking token - the user accepts. 
    
    Upon arrival at the venue, while passing through the gates, users holding a device tap/scan the venue's NFC/QR: 
    - the venue opens a char for the identity Vault to perform the authentication, and then the venue opens the gate. 
    
    Users holding an offline token (e.g., NFC, QR) tap/scan their token's NFC/QR in the venue's reader: 
    - the venue takes a photo of the user, asks the token's identity Vault to match the user's photo, then opens the gate.
