**How to get a COVID certificate for a flight check-in?**
--


Users can chat with their health Vault to ask for a COVID certificate.
- In this example, we use the 🏥 National Health Service (NHS) in the 🇬🇧 UK.
- For this to work, 🛩️ airlines must trust 🏥 NHS-issued COVID certificates.


In a global scenario, 
- 🛩️ airlines trust the 🌐 International Air Transport Association (IATA), 
- 🌐 IATA trusts the 🇺🇳 World Health Organization (WHO),
- 🇺🇳 WHO trusts the 🇬🇧 United Kingdom (UK), 
- and 🇬🇧 UK trusts their 🏥 National Health Service (NHS).


Used initiate a chat with 🏥 NHS.
