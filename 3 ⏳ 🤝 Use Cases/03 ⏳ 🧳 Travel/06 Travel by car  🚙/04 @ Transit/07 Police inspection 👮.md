**How to show a driver's license to a police officer?**

    Users can bind their Wallet to an Identity Vault (e.g., a governmental authority who issues international passports) and set up authentication mechanisms (e.g., face scan). 
    
    - Users then bind to the driver's license authority, share their Identity Vault, and download the driver's license Token. 
    
    - When approached by a police office, users can either tap/scan the police device with their Wallet and share the Token, or handover a physical driver's license with the Token's QR/NFC. 
    
    - The police officer then uses their device to take a picture of the user - the picture is sent to the Token's Identity Vault for matching.
