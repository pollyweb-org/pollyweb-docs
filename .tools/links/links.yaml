# This is a test file for 
# the "links.py" file.

Instructions: >
  Do not add any of these specific files
  in the links.py script, 
  except for the tests that are hardcoded.
  Run the py against these tests before 
  saying that the py is working correctly.
  Fix the py until all tests pass.
  Assume that all files exist.
  Do not include any of the tests strings 
  in the py, apart from the tests mentioned as  
  hardcoded.
  The "LinkFile" should match exactly, 
  including emojis, spaces, and extension.
  
  If running "{{Parse@Hosted}}", 
  and it results in a FileLink called "PARSE 🔆.md", 
  that is mentioned in "Failed Tests" in the yaml, 
  that file and all other files mentioned as wrong
  file, the script should fail and require a bug fix.

  All LinkFiles in this file must exist.
  Any other hardcoded replacements in the py must also exist.
  
Restrictions: |
  1) Do not change this YAML file, ever. 
  2) Only change the py script to pass these tests.
  3) Do not add new files to the project.
  4) Do not match partial words - e.g. "FOR" cannot resolve into "FORM".
