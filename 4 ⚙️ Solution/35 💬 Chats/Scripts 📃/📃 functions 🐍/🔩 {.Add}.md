1. **What is the .Add function?**

    `{.Add}` 
    * is a [{Function} 🐍](<../📃 basics/Function 🐍.md>) 
    * that sums math and time,
    * appends text, 
    * appends and merges lists, 
    * and merges objects.

1. **What are usage examples?**

    | Type      | Task  | Inputs   | Result
    |-|-|-|-
    | `Math`    | Sum   | `1, 2, 3` | `6`
    |           | Subtract | `4, -1, -1` | `2`
    | `Time`    | Sum    | `.Today, 1:30:00` | -
    |           | Subtract | `.Now, 1 day ago` | -
    | `Text`    | Append | `AB, 1, 2` | `AB12`
    | `Lists`   | Append | `[1,2], 3, A` | `[1,2,3,A]`
    |           | Merge  | `[1,2],[3,4]` | `[1,2,3,4]`
    | `Objects` | Merge  | `{A:1},{B:2}` | `{A:1,B:2}`

1. **How does the time work?**

    Adding time works 
    * with functions that return time, e.g. [`.Now`](<🔩 {.Now}.md>) and [`.Today`](<🔩 {.Today}.md>)
    * as well as with [Holders 🧠](<../📃 basics/Holder 🧠.md>) containing timestamps.
  
    <br/>

1. **What are the supported combinations?**

    A timestamp with a number followed by:
    * second, seconds, minute, minutes, hour, hours
    * day, days, month, months, year, or years;
    * plus `ago` for times in the past.

    A timestamp with a string formatted in `HH:MI:SS` - e.g.:
    * `1:23:45` for 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 45 seconds
    * `1:23` for 1 minute and 23 seconds
    * `1` for 1 second;
    * plus `ago` for times in the past.

    A timestamp with another timestamp:
    * always outputs the second timestamp;
    * this allows to use `.Add($time, $any)` 
        * where `$any` is either an absolute timestamp 
        * or a relative description like `1 day ago`.
