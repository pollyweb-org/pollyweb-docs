1. **How does the time work?**

    Adding time works 
    * with functions that return time, e.g. [`.Now`](<🔩 {.Now}.md>) and [`.Today`](<🔩 {.Today}.md>)
    * as well as with [Placeholders 🧠](<../...placeholders 🧠/$Placeholder 🧠.md>) containing timestamps.

    It supports the followings combinations:

    * a Time with another Time
  
    * a Time with a number followed by:
        * second, seconds, minute, minutes, hour, hours
        * day, days, month, months, year, years
  
    * a Time with a string formatted in `HH:MI:SS` - e.g.:
        * `1:23:45` for 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 45 seconds
        * `1:23` for 1 minute and 23 seconds
        * `1` for 1 second
