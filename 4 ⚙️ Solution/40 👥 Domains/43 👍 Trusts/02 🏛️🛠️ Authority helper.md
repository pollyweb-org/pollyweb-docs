1. **What is an Authority domain in NLWeb?**

    An Authority is a domain focused on supporting data exchange among domains in the NLWeb via: 
    - converting legal agreements into [trust 👍](<01 👍 Domain Trust.md>) relationships (e.g., international commerce federations);
    - converting standards to [Schema Codes 🧩](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/24 🗄️ Vaults/02 🧩 Schema Code.md>) (e.g., electronic passports); and 
    - publishing reference [🪣 Datasets](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/12 💬 Chats/07 🪣🎭 Dataset role.md>) for automated issues (e.g., accessibility codes for international travel).

1. **Why are Authorities important?**

    To scale globally to millions of domains, NLWeb advocates for international organizations to digitalize their existing cooperation protocols. 
    
    * Consider a British citizen with special mobility needs who is flying to Italy via Air France and will need a wheelchair on arrival - this citizen can use their mobility card from the UK's national health system (NHS) because there is an international chain of trust that allows the Italian government to confidently provide the wheelchair to the citizen.

1. **How to aggregate Manifests managed by subdomains?**

    Admins of Authorities are typically concerned about the management of a hierarchy of [Manifests 📜](<../44 📜 Manifests/01 📜 Domain Manifest.md>) (e.g., `any-nation.org` may expose top-level codes that are defined by the nation's health service at `health-any-nation.org`). This can be done by cross-referencing the Manifests of multiple domains.

1. **How do other domains parse the hierarchies?**

    They shouldn't. 
    
    * Instead, domains should rely on [Graphs 🕸](<../44 📜 Manifests/03 🕸🛠️ Graph helper.md>) to index the [Schema Codes 🧩](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/24 🗄️ Vaults/02 🧩 Schema Code.md>) on their behalf.
