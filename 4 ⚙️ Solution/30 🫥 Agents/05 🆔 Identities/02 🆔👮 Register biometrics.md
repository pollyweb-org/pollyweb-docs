1. **How do users set up an Identity vault?**

    ![](<00 📎 Assets/🆔 Biometrics.png>)

    [Identity 🆔 vaults](<01 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) require users to collect their biometric signatures in a [supervised 👮](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/2 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/06 👮 Supervised ID landscape/00 👮 Supervised ID Index.md>) biometric collection center, typically managed by public authorities.
    
    Advantages of this restriction include: 
    - mitigated risk of identity fraud in supervised settings;
    - delegated trust in sovereign nations' management of citizen biometrics;
    - reduced AI risk exposure for domains requiring human authentication;
    - alignment with the Europe Union (EU) AI Act, released in 2024.

    The biometric center:
    * collects the user's biometrics (e.g., [Face 😶](<04 🆔😶 Face scan.md>), [palm 🖐️](<05 🆔🖐️ Palm scan.md>), voice), 
    * tags it to a limited set of verifiable codes (e.g., passport number, national ID, social security), 
    * and stores it in compliance with data residency regulations.
