1. **xx?**



In multi-level places (subways, airports, malls):
- reads signs
- each sign points to a domain with a map
- each point in map may point to other map domains
- the navigator merges the maps to create a path

---

Walking outside (or on a bike):
- fills gaps with with directions from Google Maps API
- corrects the positioning with signs on walls

---

On the road (tunnels, crossroads):
- cars read tags with an active directional RFID reader
- drivers need to buy the reader
- manufactures can integrate the reader in new cars
- municipalities add tags to signs and create maps

---


Data sync:
- knows the common places from persona addresses
- knows time-related places from scheduler
- knows user preferences from folder editor


---

Sharing:
- shares directions with taxis and public transports
- authenticates with shared codes before sharing directions on ride hailing

---

Monitoring:
- alerts about the time required to meet calendar appointments based on current position
- tracks the person and warns on deviations from path (e.g. on a taxi)
