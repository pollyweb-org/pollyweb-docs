    No, [Persona 🧢](<../02 🧢 Personas/02 🧢🫥 Persona agent.md>) vaults don't store medical data. 
    - Medical information, like allergies, fall under specific data protection and privacy regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - U.S.).
    - Vitalogists 💖 already need to follow these regulations, so they should not add that responsibility to [Persona](<../02 🧢 Personas/02 🧢🫥 Persona agent.md>) vaults.
