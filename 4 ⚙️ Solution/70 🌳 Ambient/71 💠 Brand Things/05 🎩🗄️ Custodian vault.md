    The process that allows a user to register a [Thing 💠](<01 💠 Thing.md>) is as follows:
    - a [Brand 🍏](<07 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>) orders a set of Things from a [Wand 🪄](<09 🪄🏭 Wand supplier.md>) domain;
    - the Wand creates the Things' [Locators 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) and informs the Brand;
    - the Brand embeds the Things' Locators into its products; 
    - a user buys the Brand's product;
    - the user taps/scans the product's Thing to initiate the registration;
    - the user registers/configures the Thing into their user-bound Custodian domain;
    - the Custodian agrees with the Wand to lock the ownership of the Thing.

    Anyone with a [Wallet 🧑‍🦰](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) can start a chat with the Thing's Custodian as a guest. 
    * There, guests can inform the owner that the Thing was found, and can initiate a return workflow. 
    * The Custodian then sends the return work order to the user's [Concierge 🛎️](<../../30 🫥 Agents/06 🛎️ Concierges/01 🛎️🫥 Concierge agent.md>), who will then help with the pick-up.
