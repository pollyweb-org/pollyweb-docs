1. **What is a Thing?**

    A Thing 💠 is an [🔆 NFC/QR Locator](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) supported by a [Brand 🍏 domain](<07 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>) that allows users to interact with the physical world using the NLWeb, as if these Things 💠 had a display.

1. **Why are Things important?** 

    While it's already possible to interact with any electronic device that has a display (e.g., a washing machine), adding an internet-connected touch display with remote control to any mechanical device brings significant challenges and costs, while being close to impossible for a hat, a pencil, or a dog.

    ![](<00 📎 Assets/💠 Thing.png>)

    Things 💠 come in a number of forms:

    - **💠 Standard Things**: 
        - all Things 💠 provide a user-controlled experience of an item bought and registered by a specific user, allowing other users to interact with it as guests - e.g.:
            - tags in T-shirts, 
            - NFC chips under the skin of pets and endangered wild animals, 
            - NFC/QR codes to stick on a 30-year-old book or pin to a 300-year-old tree.

        - besides supporting all features of standard Things 💠, [Userables 💍](<../74 💍 Brand Userables/01 💍 Userable thing.md>) allow users without a smart device to make payments and access restricted areas, and are typically an NFC embedded into objects that a user may carry;
          - e.g.: jewelry, glasses, key holders.

        - besides supporting all features of [Userables 💍](<../74 💍 Brand Userables/01 💍 Userable thing.md>), a [⌚ Tapband](<../76 ⌚ Brand Tapbands/01 ⌚💠 Tapband thing.md>) allow users to also open [Padlocks 🔒](<../75 🔒 Brand Padlocks/01 🔒 Padlock device.md>) while assuring users cannot be traced between interactions with [Host 🤗 domains](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>).


    - [**🤖 Robot specialization**](<../72 🤖 Brand Robots/01 🤖💠 Robot thing.md>):

2. **What can a user do with a Thing?**

    ![](<00 📎 Assets/💠 Thing$Actions.png>)

    Things 💠 behave differently when interacting with Owners (the user who registered the Thing 💠 after buying it) and Guests (users who are not the owner).

    Owner features, available via their [Custodian 🧳 agent](<05 🧳🗄️ Custodian vault.md>):
    - **Register**: take ownership of a recently acquired unregistered Thing 💠;
    - **Transfer**: give ownership to a second-hand owner;
    - **Contact Brand**: ask for after-sales support - e.g., troubleshooting;
    - **Report lost/stolen**: activate the "return found item" for Guests;
    - **Set landing page**: create Wikipedia like descriptions for landmarks;
    - **Manage groups**: create groups for note sharing, invite/promote users;
    - **Set permissions**: give groups (e.g., family) access to owner features;
    - All other features available to guests.
    
    Guest features:
    - **Search instructions**: use natural language to navigate manuals;
    - **Add private notes**: e.g, write down passwords and attach invoices;
    - **Join groups**: e.g., operate and remotely control family devices;
    - **Call emergency services**: in one click, share location and contacts;
    - **Contact the owner**: e.g., notify that a runaway pet was found;
    - **Return found item**: start a logistics workflow to return the Thing.

3. **Are Things similar to digital twins of physical devices?**

    Yes, but more. 
    
    * Digital twins are a digital representation of an object's characteristics and functionalities;
        * e.g., a machine in a factory.

    * While Things 💠 can work as digital twins, they also expand the functionalities of the object they represent, proving an anthropomorphic (human-like) behavior to non-human entities, such as animals, landmarks, and objects;
        * e.g., a seashell can now have a conversation with you about the story of its life.
