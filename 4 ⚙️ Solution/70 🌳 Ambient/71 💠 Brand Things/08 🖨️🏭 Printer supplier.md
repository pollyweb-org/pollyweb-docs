1. **What is a Printer domain in NLWeb?**

    Printers are [Supplier 🏭](<../../30 🫥 Agents/06 🛎️ Concierges/02 🏭🎭 Supplier role.md>) domains specialized in printing and managing NFC/QR [Locators 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) on behalf of [Brand 🍏](<07 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>) domains or any other [Host 🤗](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) domain.

1. **Why are Printers important for Users?**

    ![](<00 📎 Assets/💠 Printer Sticker.png>)

    Printers allow users to turn any object into a smart object;
    - e.g., before going on trip through Asia, a user can buy a smart sticker in a supermarket then stick it on their old-yet-cherished notebook of memories so that anyone can return it free of charge if left behind.

1. **Why are Printers important for Hosts?**

    ![](<00 📎 Assets/💠 Printer Collar.png>)

    Printers offload from [Host 🤗](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) domains the undifferentiated task of printing and distributing NFC/QR [Locators 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>).

1. **How do Printers monetize?**

    That's up to the Printer domain. 
    
    Possible ways are:

    - **Direct sell**: Printers may sell generic stickers and tags in supermarkets for users to enhance their existing objects;
    
    - **Supplier sell**: Printers may supply [Brands 🍏](<07 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>) and other Hosts with printed Locators that these domains then integrate into their products.

1. **What are the possible formats and sizes?**

    Printed [Locators 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) come in many shapes and sizes, including:
    - 👕 textile labels for [clothing 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/14 📺 NFC in clothing.md>);
    - 🐬 under-skin chips for animals;
    - 💍 micro NFC chips for jewelry;
    - 📚 stickers for everyday objects (e.g., books);
    - 🖨️ plastic plaques to embed in home appliances;
    - 🐶 ID tags for pets;
    - 🌳 metal plaques for landmarks.

1. **Do Hosts have to know the Locators in advance?**

    Not necessarily. 
    
    Printers work with two options:

    - **with provided Locators**: the [Host 🤗](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) domain sends a supply order with the [Locators 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) to be printed, the quantity, and the format;
        - these are preferred where the [Locator 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) is customized for a certain [Host 🤗](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) resource 
        - e.g., `any-supermarket.com/london-store` to reference a specific store in a chain of supermarkets.

    - **with anonymous Locators**: the [Host 🤗](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) domains sends a supply order just specifying the quantity, the format, and the commitment lifetime;
        - these are preferred where the [Host 🤗](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) wants to bind the [Locator 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) at the final manufacturing stage, saving the logistical challenge of matching [Locators 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) to the right product through the assembly process.

1. **How are anonymous Locators translated?**

    Printers manage anonymous [Locators 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) with a redirection (e.g., `any-printer.com/random-locator`) that will be bound later to a final [Locator 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>). 
    - For this, Printers charge [Hosts](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) for a commitment lifetime, after which the redirection stops working, turning the [Locator 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) useless.
