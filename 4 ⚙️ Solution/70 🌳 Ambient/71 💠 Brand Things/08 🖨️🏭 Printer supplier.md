1. **Why are Printers important for Users?**

    ![](<./00 ✅ 📎 Assets/💠 Printer Sticker.png>)

    Printers allow users to turn any object into a smart object;
    - e.g., before going on trip through Asia, a user can buy a smart sticker in a supermarket then stick it on their old-yet-cherished notebook of memories so that anyone can return it free of charge if left behind.

1. **Why are Printers important for Hosts?**

    Printers offload from Hosts the undifferentiated task of printing and distributing NFC/QR Locators.

1. **How do Printers monetize?**

    That's up to the Printer domain. 
    
    Possible ways are:

    - **Direct sell**: Printers may sell generic stickers and tags in supermarkets for users to enhance their existing objects;
    
    - **Supplier sell**: Printers may supply Brands and other Hosts with printed Locators that these domains then integrate into their products.

1. **What are the possible formats and sizes?**

    Printed Locators come in many shapes and sizes, including:
    - 👕 textile labels for clothing;
    - 🐬 under-skin chips for animals;
    - 💍 micro NFC chips for jewelry;
    - 📚 stickers for everyday objects (e.g., books);
    - 🖨️ plastic plaques to embed in home appliances;
    - 🐶 ID tags for pets;
    - 🌳 metal plaques for landmarks.

1. **Do Hosts have to know the Locators in advance?**

    Not necessarily. 
    
    Printers work with two options:

    - **with provided Locators**: the Host domain sends a supply order with the Locators to be printed, the quantity, and the format;
        - these are preferred where the Locator is customized for a certain Host resource 
        - e.g., `any-supermarket.com/london-store` to reference a specific store in a chain of supermarkets.

    - **with anonymous Locators**: the Host domains sends a supply order just specifying the quantity, the format, and the commitment lifetime;
        - these are preferred where the Host wants to bind the Locator at the final manufacturing stage, saving the logistical challenge of matching Locators to the right product through the assembly process.

1. **How are anonymous Locators translated?**

    Printers manage anonymous Locators with a redirection (e.g., `any-printer.com/random-locator`) that will be bound later to a final Locator. 
    - For this, Printers charge [Hosts](<../../20 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 ✅ 💬 Chats/03 ✅ 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) for a commitment lifetime, after which the redirection stops working, turning the Locator useless.
