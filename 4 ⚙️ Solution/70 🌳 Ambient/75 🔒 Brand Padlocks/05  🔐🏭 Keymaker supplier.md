1. **What is a Keymaker domain helper?**

    Keymakers 🔐 are [Suppliers 🏭](<../../30 🫥 Agents/06 🛎️ Concierges/02 🏭🎭 Supplier role.md>) that supply and manage the lifecycle of [Padlocks 🔒](<01 🔒 Padlock device.md>) on behalf of [Brands 🍏](<../71 💠 Brand Things/07 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>).

    ---

1. **What is the commitment of Keymakers to Brands?**

    When supplying [Padlocks 🔒](<01 🔒 Padlock device.md>) to [Brands 🍏](<../71 💠 Brand Things/07 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>), Keymakers 🔐 commit to manage the following features for an agreed time period (e.g., 10 years, forever):
    - accept registrations from [🌼 Keyboxes](<04 🌼🗄️ Keybox vault.md>);
    - continuously rotate the Padlock's key;
    - continuously propagate the Padlock's battery status.

1. **What happens when a Keymaker's commitment ends?**

    The [Padlock 🔒](<01 🔒 Padlock device.md>) won't unlock anymore, unless the a physical backup key is used.

    ---

1. **Are Padlock's key rotations encrypted in transit?**

    Yes.
    * Both the sequence and the passkey are encrypted using the [Padlock 🔒](<01 🔒 Padlock device.md>)'s public key, so that only the [Padlock 🔒](<01 🔒 Padlock device.md>) is able to read them using its private key. 
    * Only the Keymaker 🔐 has the public key of the Padlock.
