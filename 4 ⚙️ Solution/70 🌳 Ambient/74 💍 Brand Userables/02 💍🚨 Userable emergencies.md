💍 Userable emergencies FAQ
===

1. **How can users set up a health emergency script?**

    In case the owner is unconscious, any guest can [tap 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) the owner's [Userable 💍 thing](<01 💍 Userable thing.md>) to start an emergency script previously configured by the owner.

    These emergency steps may include:
    - inform close family members, 
    - make a group phone call, 
    - notify the health insurance company.

1. **How does it work?**

    ![](<00 📎 Assets/💍 Userable Emergency.png>)

    |#|Category|Step
    |-|-|-
    |1| `Tap the NFC` | A guest user [taps 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) the [rotating NFC tag 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/11 📺 NFC authentication.md>) of the [Userable 💍 thing](<01 💍 Userable thing.md>) with their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>).
    |2| `Interact`| A [Chat 💬](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/01 💬 Chat.md>) opens with the [Userable's Wand 🪄 domain](<../71 💠 Brand Things/09 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>) (i.e., the helper defined by the [Userable's Brand 🍏 domain](<../71 💠 Brand Things/07 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>)) - this allows the guest user to read the landing notes that the owner user left, and allowing the guest to active the emergency script defined by the owner user.
    |3| `Authenticate` | The [Userable's Wand 🪄 domain](<../71 💠 Brand Things/09 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>) asks the [guest user's Identity 🆔 agent](<../../30 🫥 Agents/05 🆔 Identities/03 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) to authenticate the guest - this allows emergency services to impose legal actions on harassment frauds if necessary.
    |4| `Activate`| The guest activates the emergency workflow - this triggers the [Userable's Wand 🪄 domain](<../71 💠 Brand Things/09 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>) to ask the [guest's Broker 🤵 domain](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/03 🤵 Brokers/03 🤵 Broker domain.md>) for the guest's location, ask the [guest's Persona 🧢 agent](<../../30 🫥 Agents/02 🧢 Personas/02 🧢🫥 Persona agent.md>) for the guest's contact details, and pass that information to the [owner's Custodian 🧳 vault](<../71 💠 Brand Things/05 🧳🗄️ Custodian vault.md>).
    |5| `Broadcast`| The [owner's Custodian 🧳 domain](<../71 💠 Brand Things/05 🧳🗄️ Custodian vault.md>) executes the emergency script defined by the owner user - e.g., perform a group call with the selected phone numbers, as well as alert emergency services, trusted medical contacts, and health insurance companies.

2. **What data is collected in an emergency?**
    
    To streamline the process, [Wand 🪄 domains](<../71 💠 Brand Things/09 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>) collect the following information from the guest user.
    
    |Data|Reason
    |-|-
    | `Contact details` | For emergency personal to get in contact with the guest.
    | `Current location`| For emergency personal to quickly get there.

3. **How are Userable owners protected from harassment frauds?**

    To avoid harassment frauds, before issuing the emergency alarm, [Wand 🪄 domains](<../71 💠 Brand Things/09 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>) request guests to be authenticated by an [Identity 🆔 domain](<../../30 🫥 Agents/05 🆔 Identities/03 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) that is [trusted 👍](<../../40 👥 Domains/43 👍 Trusts/01 👍 Domain Trust.md>) by the [Wand 🪄 domain](<../71 💠 Brand Things/09 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>).

4. **How can the process be simplified for speed?**

    Owners with high risk (e.g., epilepsy, heart disease) may speed up the rescue by adding instructions directly to the landing page and/or by removing the need for guests to authenticate before activating an emergency.
