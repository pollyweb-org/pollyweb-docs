1. **How can users pay to a salesperson with Userables?**



    [Custodians 🧳](<../../50 🫥 Agents/35 🧳 Custodians/$ 🧳🫥 Custodian agent.md>) integrate with [💳 Payers](<../../50 🫥 Agents/60 💳 Payers/03 💳🎭 Payer role.md>) to allow users to pay with their [Userables 💍](<01 💍 Userable thing.md>) after being authenticated by their [Identity 🆔](<../../../../../../../4 ⚙️ Solution/50 🫥 Agents/45 🆔 Identities/$ 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) (e.g., face scan). 
    
    * This allows sales people to use their own [Wallets 🧑‍🦰](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/$ 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) as a chat interface for the user.
