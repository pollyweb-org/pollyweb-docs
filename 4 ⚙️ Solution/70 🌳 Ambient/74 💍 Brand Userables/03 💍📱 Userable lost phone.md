1. **How can users find their phone with their Userable?**

    If an owner misplaces their phone, they can tap their [Userable 💍](<01 💍 Userable thing.md>) in someone else's [Wallet 🧑‍🦰](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) to:
    - read their landing notes for memory tips, 
    - authenticate to access their owner area (e.g., face scan) 
    - see the current location of their phone, 
    - remotely ring their phone, 
    - and contact any of their contacts.
