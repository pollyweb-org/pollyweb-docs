💍 Userable find my phone FAQ
===


1. **How can users find their phone with their Userable?**

    If an owner misplaces their phone, they can [tap 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) their [Userable 💍 thing](<01 💍 Userable thing.md>) in someone else's [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) to:
    - read their landing notes for memory tips, 
    - authenticate to access their owner area (e.g., face scan) 
    - see the current location of their phone, 
    - remotely ring their phone, 
    - and contact any of their contacts.

    |#|Category|Step|
    |-|-|-
    |1| `Tap the NFC` | A guest user [taps 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) the [rotating NFC tag 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/11 📺 NFC authentication.md>) of the [Userable 💍 thing](<01 💍 Userable thing.md>) with their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>). 
    |2| `Interact`| A [Chat 💬](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/01 💬 Chat.md>) opens with the [Userable's Wand 🪄 domain](<../71 💠 Brand Things/09 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>), allowing the guest user to read the landing notes that the owner user left, and allowing the guest to active the emergency script defined by the owner user.
