1. **Are Userables trackable, like Apple AirTags?**

    No.
     
    - NFC Userables use passive NFC, thus requiring a powered reader to come into contact with them, similar to traditional touchless bank cards.

    - Conversely, Apple Tags can be trackable because they use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with any Apple device from up to 100 meters away.
