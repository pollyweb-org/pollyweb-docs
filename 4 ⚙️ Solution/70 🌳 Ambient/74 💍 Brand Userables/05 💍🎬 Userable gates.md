1. **How can users pass airport border controls with Userables?**

    Users can tell [Custodians 🎩](<../71 💠 Brand Things/05 🎩🗄️ Custodian vault.md>) which [Tokens 🎫](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/25 🎫 Tokens/01 🎫 Token.md>) should be available on their [Userables 💍](<01 💍 Userable thing.md>) for automatic sharing on request. 
    
    - When [Consumer 💼](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/27 💼 Consumers/04 💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) domains ask for expected Tokens (e.g., an airport gate expects passport Tokens), the Custodian can immediately share it without having to be in the context of a chat.
