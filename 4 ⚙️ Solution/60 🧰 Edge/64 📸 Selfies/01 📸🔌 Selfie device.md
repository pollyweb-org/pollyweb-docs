1. **Why are Selfie devices important for NLWeb?**

    Selfie 📸 devices allow [Host 🤗 domains](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 💬 Chats/03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) to request the user's [Identity 🆔 agent](<../../30 🫥 Agents/05 🆔 Identities/03 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) to perform a [Face scan 🆔😶](<../../30 🫥 Agents/05 🆔 Identities/04 🆔😶 Face scan.md>) on the user in a physical place whenever the user doesn't have a smartphone with them, or doesn't have internet.

    Use cases include:
    - boarding a plane, like in United Airlines;
    - boarding a train, like in Osaka Subway;
    - entering the United Kingdom in border control.

    Notes: 
    - scanning the user's face is not enough to identify the user;
    - the identification is first done by a [Userable 💍 thing](<../../70 🌳 Ambient/74 💍 Brand Userables/01 💍 Userable thing.md>), then the [Face scan 🆔😶](<../../30 🫥 Agents/05 🆔 Identities/04 🆔😶 Face scan.md>) is invoked to verify the identity.
