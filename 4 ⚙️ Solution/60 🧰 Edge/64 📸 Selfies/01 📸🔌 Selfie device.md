1. **What are Selfie devices?**

    A Selfie 📸 is a [Pluggable 🔌 device](<../61 🔌 Pluggables/01 🔌 Pluggable device.md>) similar to a smartphone or a tablet, with a screen and a camera, used to verify if the expected user is looking at the camera.

1. **Why are Selfie devices important for NLWeb?**

    Selfie 📸 devices allow [Host 🤗 domains](<../../41 🎭 Domain Roles/Hosts 🤗/🤗🎭 Host role.md>) to request the user's [Identity 🆔 agent](<../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identities 🆔/🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) to perform a [Face scan 🆔😶](<../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identities 🆔/🆔⏩ Identity flows/6 🆔⏩😶 Face scan.md>) on the user in a physical place whenever the user doesn't have a smartphone with them, or doesn't have internet.

    Use cases include:
    - boarding a plane, like in United Airlines;
    - boarding a train, like in Osaka Subway;
    - entering the United Kingdom in border control.

    Notes: 
    - scanning the user's face is not enough to identify the user;
    - the identification is first done by a [Userable 💍 thing](<../../25 🔆 Locators/4 💍 Userables/💍💠 Userable thing.md>), then the [Face scan 🆔😶](<../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identities 🆔/🆔⏩ Identity flows/6 🆔⏩😶 Face scan.md>) is invoked to verify the identity.
