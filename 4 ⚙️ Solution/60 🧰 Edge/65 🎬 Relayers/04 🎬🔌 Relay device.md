1. **What is a Relay device?**

    Relays are [Pluggables 🔌](<../61 🔌 Pluggables/01 🔌 Pluggable device.md>) aimed to remotely change the state of a hardware (e.g., open/close a gate, turn a light on/off).

1. **How do Relays differ from Padlocks?**

    While [Padlocks 🔒](<../../70 🌳 Ambient/75 🔒 Padlocks/$ 🔒 Padlock device.md>) can also be used to open doors, they differ from Relayers in a number of ways:
    * Proximity - Relayers are global, Padlocks are short range only;
    * Internet - Relayers need internet, Padlocks work offline;
    * Identity - Relayers use [🆔 Identities](<../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>), Padlocks are anonymous;
    * Userables - Relayers support [Userables 💍](<../../25 🔆 Locators/Userables 💍/💍💠 Userable thing.md>), Padlocks don't.

1. **What are examples of use cases for Relays?**

    Use cases for Relays include:
    * Home garages, where users need to open the garage door from a distance;
    * Airport and subway gates, when the opening is controlled by a server;
    * Open room doors in hotels, when controlled centrally;
    * Open a door to a restrict area, when controlled centrally.
