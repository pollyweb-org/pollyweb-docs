🦋 Ephemeral domains FAQ
===

1. **What is an Ephemeral domain in NLWeb?**

    An Ephemeral 🦋 domain is a [Supplier 🏭](<../../30 🫥 Agents/06 🛎️ Concierges/02 🏭🎭 Supplier role.md>) of [Ephemeral 🦋](<03 🦋🔌 Ephemeral devices.md>) devices that allow other domains to buy devices. 
    * It handles the orders, delivery, and management of the devices on behalf of the buyer.
    * When a user taps/scans an [Ephemeral 🦋](<03 🦋🔌 Ephemeral devices.md>) [Locator 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>), the Ephemeral domain does the translation on behalf of the buyer domain, and triggers the internal [Locator 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) of the buyer domain.
