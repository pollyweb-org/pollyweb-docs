# Blocking unstructured questions 💬 💭

> Part of [Prompts 🤔](<01 🤔 Prompt.md>)

This is a blocking input [Prompt 🤔](<01 🤔 Prompt.md>) that allows the user to type something instead of having to follow a structured format;
- it allows for large-language models (LLMs) to interpret the user's intent from natural language text, while also providing a structured input to facilitate the user's interaction;
    - e.g., a user may select the "Yes" option, or type "ok" in the textbox;
- the speech emoji 💬 represent the chat's [Host 🤗 domain](<../12 💬 Chats/04 🤗🎭 Host role.md>);
- the thought emoji 💭 represents other domains that have been pulled into the chat.
