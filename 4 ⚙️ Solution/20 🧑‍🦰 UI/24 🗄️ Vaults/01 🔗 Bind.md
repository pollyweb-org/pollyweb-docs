## FAQ

1. **What is a Bind?**

    A Bind is a trust relationship between a [Wallet 🧑‍🦰](<../23 💬 Chats/02 🧑‍🦰💬 Wallet chats.md>) and [Vault 🗄️](<03 🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) for a given [Schema Codes 🧩](<02 🧩 Schema Code.md>).

2. **Where do users get the list of Vaults from?**

    For a domain to be listed as a [Vault 🗄️](<03 🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) in the user's [Wallet 🧑‍🦰](<../23 💬 Chats/02 🧑‍🦰💬 Wallet chats.md>), the user first needs to bind the domain to the wallet. 
    
    This can be done in two ways: 
    - 1/ the user initiates a chat with the domain and provides the authentication data required by the domain (e.g., login and password); or 
    - 2/ the user initiates a session in the target domain using the domain's mobile website or mobile app, and then clicks on a "bind wallet" button provided to the domain. 
    
    The user can then select one or more [Schema Codes 🧩](<02 🧩 Schema Code.md>) to bind, from the list of available binds provided to the user by the domain.
