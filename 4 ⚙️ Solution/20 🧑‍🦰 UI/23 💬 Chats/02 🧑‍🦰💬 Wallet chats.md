🧑‍🦰💬 Chat user experience (UX) FAQ
===

1. **How does a user open a new chat window with a domain?**

    To open a new [Chat 💬](<01 💬 Chat.md>) window with a [Host 🤗 domain](<03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>), a user needs the [Host's Locator 🔆](<../22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) contained in one of the following technology forms.

    |Technology|Details
    |-|-
    |[✨ QR code](<../22 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>)| Users open the Wallet app on the device, then scan the QR code to open a chat window.
    |[🔆 NFC tag](<../22 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>)| Users tap the NFC tag with their device, regardless of having the [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) open - this opens a chat window on the Wallet.
    |[🌐 Link](<../22 🔆 Locators/02 🧑‍🦰🌐 Wallet URLs.md>)| Users click the link/button on the traditional web browser of their device - this opens a chat window on the [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>).
    |[💬 Prompt](<01 💬 Chat.md>)| In a [Chat 💬](<01 💬 Chat.md>) window, the [Host 🤗 domain](<03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) provides one or more options for the user to select from, and the user selects one - this opens a new [Chat 💬](<01 💬 Chat.md>) window.

2. **What if the user doesn't have the domain's Locator?**

    If a user doesn't know exactly where to find a [Locator 🔆](<../22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>), they can use the [Finder 🔎 domain](<../../30 🫥 Agents/10 🔎 Finders/02 🔎🫥 Finder vault.md>) to search for it;
    * e.g., if a UK user wants to bind to the UK's national health service but doesn't know where to start, the user can ask for "health service" and the assistance replies with "NHS?".

3. **Can users send a sequence of messages in a chat?**

    No. 
    - NLWeb [Chats 💬](<01 💬 Chat.md>) don't implement WhatsApp's free flow conversation, where users can send multiple messages in sequence that humans typically interpret as a flow. 
    - Instead, NLWeb [Chats 💬](<01 💬 Chat.md>) work like ChatGPT, with one party sending only one message then waiting for the other party to reply. 
    - A similar mechanism is used by Amazon Retail for web and mobile customer support backed by AI workflows.

4. **How can users report spam messages?**

    Like in WhatsApp, users can mark messages as spam.

5. **How can users report a domain's misconduct?**

    Like in WhatsApp, users can report or block a domain, providing the reason for it (e.g., offensive, unsolicited, spam).

    ---

6. **How can users contribute to a domain's reputation?**

    Users can provide feedback to domains via stars and comments. 
    * Also, by reporting on domains, users are contributing negatively to the domain's reputation. 
    * [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 apps](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) share this feedback collaboratively with other Wallets via [Reviewer ⭐ domains](<../../30 🫥 Agents/10 🔎 Finders/01 ⭐🫥 Reviewer vault.md>). 
    * [Host 🤗 domain](<03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) managers are notified about the feedback, and can reply to them. Similar mechanisms have been widely adopted by Trust Pilot, Google Maps, and Google Play.

7. **Do chats support map navigation?**

    No. 
    - [Host 🤗 domains](<03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) can send location pins in user chats, then users can click on them to open the device's default map navigation app.
