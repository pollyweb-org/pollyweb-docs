🧑‍🦰💬 Chat user experience (UX) FAQ
===

1. **How does a user open a new chat window with a domain?**

    To open a new chat window with a domain, a user needs the domain's NLWeb [Locator 🔆](<../22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>) contained in a QR code, NFC tag, web link, or chat option: 

    - for **✨ QR codes**, users open the Wallet app on the device, then [scan](<../22 🔆 Locators/03 🧑‍🦰✨ Wallet QR scan.md>) the QR code to open a chat window; 

    - for **🔆 NFC tags**, users [tap](<../22 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) the NFC tag with their device, regardless of having the [Wallet app](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) open - this opens a chat window on the Wallet; 

    - for **🌐 web links**, users [click](<../22 🔆 Locators/02 🧑‍🦰🌐 Wallet URLs.md>) the link/button on the traditional web browser of their device - this opens a chat window on the [Wallet app 🧑‍🦰](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>); and 
    
    - for **💬 chat options**, the [Host 🤗](<03 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) domain in a chat window provides one or more options for the user to select from, and the user selects one - this opens a new chat window on the [Wallet app 🧑‍🦰](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>).

1. **What if the user doesn't have the domain's Locator?**

    If a user doesn't know exactly where to find a [Locator 🔆](<../22 🔆 Locators/01 🔆 Locator.md>), they can use the [Finder 🔎](<../../30 🫥 Agents/10 🔎 Finders/02 🔎🫥 Finder vault.md>) domain to search for it;
    - e.g., if a UK user wants to bind to the UK's national health service but doesn't know where to start, the user can ask for "health service" and the assistance replies with "NHS?".

1. **Can users send a sequence of messages in a chat?**

    No. 
    - NLWeb chats don't implement WhatsApp's free flow conversation, where users can send multiple messages in sequence that humans typically interpret as a flow. 
    - Instead, NLWeb chats work like ChatGPT, with one party sending only one message then waiting for the other party to reply. 
    - A similar mechanism is used by Amazon Retail for web and mobile customer support backed by AI workflows.

1. **How can users report spam messages?**

    Like in WhatsApp, users can mark messages as spam.

1. **How can users report a domain's misconduct?**

    Like in WhatsApp, users can report or block a domain, providing the reason for it (e.g., offensive, unsolicited, spam).

    ---

1. **How can users contribute to a domain's reputation?**

    Users can provide feedback to domains via stars and comments. Also, by reporting on domains, users are contributing negatively to the domain's reputation. 
    
    * Wallets share this feedback collaboratively with other Wallets via [Reviewer ⭐](<../../30 🫥 Agents/10 🔎 Finders/01 ⭐🫥 Reviewer vault.md>) domains. 
    
    * Domain managers are notified about the feedback, and can reply to them. Similar mechanisms have been widely adopted by Trust Pilot, Google Maps, and Google Play.

1. **Do chats support map navigation?**

    No. Domains can send location pins in user chats, then users can click on them to open the device's default map navigation app.
