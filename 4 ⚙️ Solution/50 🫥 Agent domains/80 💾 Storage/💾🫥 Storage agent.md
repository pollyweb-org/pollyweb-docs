1. **What is a Storage domain in NLWeb?**

    A [Storage 💾 domain](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>) is a shared repository [Vault 🗄️](<../../41 🎭 Domain Roles/80 🗄️ Vaults/🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) that users can subscribe to keep their data in the cloud, similar to Dropbox and Google Drive, with the intent of being shared with other services.

1. **Why are Storage domains important for other domains?**

    [Storage 💾 domains](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>) allow other services to store the user's data in a repository controlled and paid by the user, offloading the cost while complying with data residency requirements.

1. **How does it help with data residency compliance?**

    [Storage 💾 domains](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>) align with the [NLWeb Sovereignty pledge 🦅](<../../../1 🎯 Mission/3 🦅 Sovereignty.md>) - e.g.:
    - to ensure data privacy compliance, a U.S. service can store the data of a German citizen in a Storage service hosted in the [AWS European Sovereign Cloud 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/02 🏳️ Sovereignty landscape/10 📺 Sovereignty @ AWS.md>), which is managed by European staff and located within German borders.

1. **How does it help low-cost services?**

    To keep costs low, a free video streaming service may offload the cost of storage to the user, by storing the user's video files on the user's [Storage 💾 agent](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>).

    ---

1. **How do Storage vaults keep data secure?**

    This is a shared responsibility.

    - [Storage 💾 vaults](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>) fully segregate each user-domain section, so that no domain can see user data from another domain, and no users can see data from other users. 

    - In parallel, NLWeb advocates for domains writing to a [Storage 💾 service](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>) to encrypt their data. 

    ---

1. **How can users set up a Storage Vault?**

    Wallets typically onboard users with a default [Storage 💾 agent](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>), allowing users to immediately taking advantage of a free tier.

    Nonetheless, users can find and bind into another [Storage 💾 agent](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>), like they do with any other Vault.

    ---

1. **Can users change to a different Storage domain?**

    Yes. 
    - The NLWeb protocol includes a mechanism from transfer between [Storage 💾 domains](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>). 
    - Failure to comply causes [Firewalls 🔥](<../../45 🤲 Helper domains/40 🔥 Firewalls/🔥🤲 Firewall helper.md>) to block the domain.

1. **How can users pay for Storage?**

    Typically, with a [subscription 🤝](<../../45 🤲 Helper domains/20 🤝 Billers/🤝🤲 Biller helper.md>), like Google Drive.

    ---

1. **How can users increase the available Storage space?**

    Typically, by upgrading the [subscription 🤝](<../../45 🤲 Helper domains/20 🤝 Billers/🤝🤲 Biller helper.md>), like Google Drive.

    ---

1. **Do users need to approve each Storage access to others domains?**

    No. Once the access if first granted, domains can access their allocated space anytime.

    ---

1. **Can users limit the storage space used by a given domain?**

    Yes. 
    - [Storage 💾 agents](<💾🫥 Storage agent.md>) allow users to define maximum allocation space per domain.

    ---

1. **How do users clean up a domain's allocated space?**

    - **Option 1:** delete all data from that domain - this is the easiest, quickest, and more destructive way.

    - **Option 2:** chose to delete only the cache and/or data from that domain, but not the settings - this is similar to how Android OS allows users to clean data from mobile apps.

    - **Option 3:** initiate a chat with that domain, and clean the storage from there - this option allows users to exclude specific files that only that domain can read (e.g., large video files).
