1. **How can users pay to a salesperson with Userables?**



    [Custodians 🧳](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Custodians 🧳/🧳🫥 Custodian agent.md>) integrate with [💳 Payers](<../../../41 🎭 Domain Roles/Payers/💳🎭 Payer role.md>) to allow users to pay with their [Userables 💍](<../💍💠 Userable thing.md>) after being authenticated by their [Identity 🆔](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identities 🆔/🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) (e.g., face scan). 
    
    * This allows sales people to use their own [Wallets 🧑‍🦰](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/1 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) as a chat interface for the user.
