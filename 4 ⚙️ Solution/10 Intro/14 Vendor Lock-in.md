1. **Who maintains and evolves PollyWeb?**

    PollyWeb follows the principles of the Web 2.0 Internet.
    
    The PollyWeb protocol is maintained and evolved by the PollyWeb Foundation - a consortium of multiple companies that advocate for the adoption of PollyWeb and assume the ultimate responsibility for the PollyWeb backbone. 
    
    The PollyWeb, on the other hand, is owned nor maintained by any specific organization, just like the Internet.
