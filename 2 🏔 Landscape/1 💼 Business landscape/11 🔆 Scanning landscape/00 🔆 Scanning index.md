🔆 Scanning landscape FAQ
===


🎯 QR codes and NFC cards have become an ubiquitous ways for users to pay for transactions (specially during the pandemic).

- However, other use cases have not gain traction (e.g., menus in restaurants). 
- Several reasons may have contributed to the lack of traction, e.g.:
    - QR/NFC payments speeds up checkouts, while digital menus make it slower;
    - QR/NFC payments don't need screen interactions, so there's no digital fatigue;
    - menus are typically long, making them hard to see on phone screens;
    - due to images, poor infrastructure, or bad network, pages may load slowly;
    - implementing a digital solution can be overwhelming for small businesses;
    - and the FBI reported bad actors replacing QR codes to perform phishing scams.


To address fraud with URL redirect by replacing real QR codes with fake ones:
- in 🇨🇳 China, WeChat and AliPay use in-app QR scan, with URL redirect blocked;
- in 🇷🇺 Russia, Kaspersky uses a QR scanner app with pre-redirect URL verification;
- and in the 🇺🇸 U.S., Apple created App Clip Codes, a rounded QR alternative.

- easy and affordable to set up and maintain by businesses;
- consuming as little network bandwidth as a natural language chat;
- using ubiquitous non-proprietary QR and NFC standards;
- and with safety validation of the QR/NFC landing page.
