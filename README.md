## What is PollyWeb?

PollyWeb is an internet layer built on top of existing infrastructure (HTTPS, DNSSEC, chat apps) that lets humans and their AI assistants interact in natural language with organizations, places, objects, and services — without installing new apps or surrendering personal data to any platform.

By scanning or clicking a PollyWeb locator with any compatible chat app, users can share credentials, ask questions, fill forms, execute workflows, and pay for transactions — while retaining full sovereignty over their data and payment methods.

## Core Principles

| | |
|-|-|
| 💬 **Open Chat Protocol** | Neutral and chat-native. Universal access via any chat app, preventing platform capture. |
| 🫥 **Multi-Agent Cooperation** | Any person or AI agent can seamlessly interact with businesses, places, and services. |
| 🎫 **Wallet-Stored Credentials** | Sovereign credentials and user control. No OS gatekeeper, no repeated PII entry. |
| 💳 **User-Sovereign Payments** | Your payment methods, your choice — not dictated by the host platform or the business. |
| 🧚 **Personal AI Curator** | User-sovereign preferences managed by your personal AI. |
| 🔒 **Privacy by Design** | Nation-sovereign biometric ID, issuer-blind verification, and domain-sovereign trust manifests. |

## Sovereignty Pledge

PollyWeb commits to giving all stakeholders genuine control:

- **Users** — own their digital twins, choose what data to share, authenticate with passkeys (not passwords), pay with their preferred method, and delegate interactions to AI assistants.
- **Businesses** — publish services via open manifests, authenticate with domain certificates (not API keys), and access third-party services on-demand without onboarding.
- **Governments** — interact directly with citizens, keep citizen data within sovereign borders, and enforce laws and regulations on the network.
