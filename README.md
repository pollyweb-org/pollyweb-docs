# Docs @ PollyWeb

Welcome to the PollyWeb documentation repository.
This repository is the source of truth for the protocol vision, user and business landscapes, solution architecture, use-case flows, schemas, and manifests that power PollyWeb.

PollyWeb is a neutral, open, and global protocol that enables people and AI agents to chat with businesses, places, and things using existing chat apps.

## Core protocol themes

- Open chat protocol: Interactions happen in chat-native interfaces, not locked to one platform.
- Multi-agent cooperation: Users and AI agents can interact with any compliant domain.
- Wallet-stored credentials: Users control credential sharing and reduce repeated PII disclosure.
- User-sovereign payments: Payment choice stays with the user.
- Privacy by design: Sovereign, compliance-aware data exchange and verification patterns.
