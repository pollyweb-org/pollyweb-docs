# 👥🚀🕸 Service @ [Graph](<../../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/40 ✅ 👥 Domains/44 ✅ 📜 Manifests/03 ✅ 🕸👥 Graph helper.md>)


## About

* Returns details about a given ServiceID in a Host's Manifest.


## Privacy

- Used by Reviewers to be able to anonymize interactions.
- It assumes that Hosts can't use sequential dynamic ServiceIDs to track users because that would required them to update their Manifests in every user interaction.
- A service definition contains questions for Hosts to understand how to improve.
