## FAQ

1. **Why isn't [`Handle@Hosted`](<../../6 🅰️ APIs/51 🧑‍💻🅰️ Hosted/01 😃🐌🧑‍💻 Handle.md>) synchronous?**

    For a number of reasons:

    * `Timeout` This allows [Hosted 📦 domains](<../../9 😃 Talkers/91 📦 Hosteds/01 📦 Hosted domain.md>) to talk as long as they want to reply.

    * `Cost` The [Talker 😃 API](<../../9 😃 Talkers/10 📘 Talker specs/10 😃 Talker.md>) doesn't need to pay cloud compute costs for idle time waiting for a response from [Hosted 📦 domains](<../../9 😃 Talkers/91 📦 Hosteds/01 📦 Hosted domain.md>).

    * `User Experience` [Hosted 📦 domains](<../../9 😃 Talkers/91 📦 Hosteds/01 📦 Hosted domain.md>) can immediately confirm that a long-running task was started, then continuously send updates regarding the task progress - see the [😃⏩🧑‍💻 Wait ⏸️](<30 😃⏩🧑‍💻 Wait ⏸️.md>) flow or details on this.

1. **Why isn't the [Talker 😃 API](<../../9 😃 Talkers/10 📘 Talker specs/10 😃 Talker.md>) a separate domain?**

    [Talkers 😃](<../../9 😃 Talkers/10 📘 Talker specs/10 😃 Talker.md>) manage a wide number of messages for multiple [domain roles 🎭](<../../4 ⚙️ Solution/40 👥 Domains/$ 👥 Domains/👥 Domain.md>);
    * e.g., [Host 🤗](<../../4 ⚙️ Solution/41 🎭 Domain Roles/30 🤗 Hosts/🤗🎭 Host role.md>), [Vault 🗄️](<../../4 ⚙️ Solution/41 🎭 Domain Roles/80 🗄️ Vaults/🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>), [Issuer 🎴](<../../4 ⚙️ Solution/41 🎭 Domain Roles/40 🎴 Issuers/🎴🎭 Issuer role.md>), [Seller 💵](<../../4 ⚙️ Solution/41 🎭 Domain Roles/70 💵 Sellers/💵🎭 Seller role.md>).
    * Exposing endpoints for each method of each role is cumbersome.
