# Contributing to PollyWeb Docs

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This repository holds the PollyWeb specification, research landscape, and use cases. Contributions that improve clarity, accuracy, or coverage are welcome.

## What you can contribute

- **Use cases** — new end-to-end flows under `3 🤝 Use Cases/`
- **Specification improvements** — corrections or clarifications under `4 ⚙️ Solution/`
- **Tooling** — improvements to the scripts under `.tools/`
- **Typos and broken links** — always welcome

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes following the conventions below.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why.

## Conventions

**File naming** — follow the existing emoji-prefixed naming pattern (e.g., `01 📺 Article title.md`). Emoji prefixes carry meaning:
- `📺` — references an external article or news item
- `🖼️` — a visual/chart overview
- `📄` — a data or market-size summary
- `00 … Index.md` — index file for a section

**Markdown style** — keep files concise. Use tables for comparisons, blockquotes (`>`) for summaries, and relative links for cross-references between documents.

**Links** — internal links must use relative paths. Run the link checker before submitting:
```bash
cd .tools/links
pip install -r requirements.txt
python links.py
```

**Assets** — place images and PDFs in a `.📎 Assets/` subfolder alongside the markdown files that reference them.

**Tone** — neutral and factual for landscape research; precise and unambiguous for specification content.
