🤖 AI agents landscape
===

🎯 The IT industry has long looked for the fleeing virtual assistant or digital twin. 
- From tools like Siri and Alexa to Hollywood’s vision in Her, the idea of a truly empathetic digital twin remains just out of reach.
- Empathy and natural language was addressed with GenAI by ChatGPT in 2022.
- Reflection, planning, and tool usage was addressed by AI agents in 2024.

🤔 However, a few parts were missing from the puzzle until now, e.g.:
- first-party knowledge about the requester - tackled by NLWeb's 🗄️ [Vaults](<../../../4 ⚙️ Solution/41 🎭 Domain Roles/80 🗄️ Vault/03 🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>);
- third-party tool discovery by requesters - tackled by NLWeb's 📜 [Manifests](<../../../4 ⚙️ Solution/40 👥 Domains/44 📜 Manifests/$ 📜 Domain Manifest.md>);
- and requester-initiated contracts - tackled by NLWeb's 📨 [Messages](<../../../4 ⚙️ Solution/40 👥 Domains/41 📨 Messages/01 📨 Domain Message.md>).

💬 NLWeb sees delegation with the following combination:
- user assistants, responsible for:
    - **user interaction** - speaks with the user in natural language;
    - **user privacy** - serves as a trusted broker to the user's data;
- service providers, responsible for:
    - **implementing services** - keeps online APIs to receive orders/requests;
    - **publishing offers** - publishes the catalog of services provided;
- orchestrators (e.g., Task Rabbit), responsible for:
    - **outcome reasoning** - defines the steps to achieve the final outcome;
    - **business discovery** - searches for potential offers from service providers;
    - **orchestration** - manages the conversation and time line with all parties;
    - **business interaction** - remotely executes the targeted business APIs;
    - **human in the loop** - bridging the gaps where AI is unable to execute;
    - **responsible AI** - establishing legal, social, and moral guardrails.
