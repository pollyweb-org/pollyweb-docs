📺 How do 🔑 FIDO passkeys implement passwordless authentication?
---

In 2024, the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance published the following video, titled *"Free Yourself From Passwords With Passkeys"*.

- The video shows how to go passwordless with passkeys.
- With passkeys, users no longer need to enter usernames and passwords or additional factors.
- Instead, a user approves a sign-in with the same process they use to unlock their device (for example, biometrics, PIN, pattern).
- Passkeys are tied to a user’s account on a website or application. 
- In 2022, Apple, Google, and Microsoft introduced FIDO Passkeys across their products.
