📺 What is the 🇬🇧 United Kingdom (UK) doing with biometrics?
---

In the United Kingdom (UK), airports like London Heathrow deployed electronic gates for travelers holding international electronic passports (e-passports) compliant with ICAO's standards.
- The process starts when the gate reads the near-field communication (NFC) chip of the e-passport.
- The gate then scans the traveler's face to match it with the low-resolution photo inside the chip.

In 2019, the UK Home Office released the following video, titled "eGates eligibility and how to use the eGates".
- The video explains how travelers can interact with the system.
