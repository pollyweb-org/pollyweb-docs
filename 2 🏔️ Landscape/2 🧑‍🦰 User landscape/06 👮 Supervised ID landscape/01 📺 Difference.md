📺 What is the difference between facial verification and facial recognition?
---

In 2021, Active Witness (a provider of cloud-based Access Control) released the following video, titled "What exactly is Facial Verification?".

- The video focused on the differences between two mechanisms for user authentication that use facial biometrics: Facial Verification and Facial Recognition.

- **Facial Verification** is a two-step authentication process where a credential ID is actively presented by the user in the first step, and then the system collects the user's face biometrics to see if it matches the given ID (e.g., when an airport's offline border-control gate reads the photo stored inside the traveler's passport and then takes a picture of the traveler to see if there is match).

    - PollyWeb advocates for general use of business-initiated facial verification, addressing privacy concerns by the general public (i.e., to access a service, users need to present a credential then perform a biometric verification of ownership of that credential).

- **Facial Recognition** is an one-step identification process where the system collects the user's face biometrics and looks for a match in a collection of pre-registered faces (e.g., the collection of passport photos of all passengers registered for a specific flight).

    - PollyWeb advocates for facial recognition when it is initiated by the user, for the benefit of the user, and restricted to access within closed circuits (e.g., after check-in at an airport, the user can go through several gates and into the airplane, just with their biometrics, and without the need to re-show the initial credential).
