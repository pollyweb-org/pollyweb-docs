🆔 Digital identity landscape
===


🎯 Digital identity allows businesses and organizations to authenticate users when offering digital services. 

- 🤔 Previous attempts to unify user identities by tech giants have failed, mostly due to privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny - e.g.: Facebook Digital Identity, Microsoft Passport in 2020, and Google+ Identity Services;

- 💬 NLWeb's approach is to delegate the authentication step of service workflows to the increasing number of governments worldwide that are transforming their citizens' physical identity documents into digital formats.
