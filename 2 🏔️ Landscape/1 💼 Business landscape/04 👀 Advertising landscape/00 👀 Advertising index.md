👀 Digital advertising landscape
===

🎯 Ads are vital to online transactions because (when used properly) they:

- enable users to access free or reduced-cost content and services;
- offer an alternative to subscription models, making content more accessible;
- support platforms and creators offering free or reduced-cost content and services;
- help smaller businesses and independent creators reach wider audiences affordably;
- provide personalized experiences by targeting user interests.

🤔 However, the ad market might be headed to a oligopoly of a [few big techs 🖼️](<03 🖼️ Top advertisers.md>):

- before the internet, advertisers relied mostly on local media channels;
- then browsers democratized targeted ads via HTTP headers and [tracking cookies 📺](<07 📺 Do-not-track button.md>);
- then platforms (e.g., [Meta 📺](<05 📺 Meta ads on apps.md>), [Amazon 📺](<06 📺 Amazon Ads.md>)) personalized ads enclosed in their ecosystems;
- now browsers (e.g., Safari, [Chrome 📺](<09 📺 Google Sandbox.md>)) proxy target audiences to protect user privacy.

- and contextualized user relevance, by applying [ambient computing 📺](<02 📺 Ambient computing.md>) concepts.
