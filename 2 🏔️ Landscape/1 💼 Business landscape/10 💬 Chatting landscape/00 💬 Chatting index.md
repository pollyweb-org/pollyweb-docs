💬 Business messaging landscape FAQ
===

🎯 There are several ways for users to interact with businesses:

1. with humans, via natural language:
    - face to face (e.g., in a physical store);
    - with traditional phones (e.g., phone calls, SMS);
    - with smart devices (e.g., email, social networks);
2. with machines, via clicks and forms:
    - on graphical native applications (e.g., Apple Store, Google Play);
    - on graphical web interfaces (e.g., WeChat);
3. with machines, with natural language.

- Until recently, humans were forced to use forms and clicks because machines didn't understand natural language.
