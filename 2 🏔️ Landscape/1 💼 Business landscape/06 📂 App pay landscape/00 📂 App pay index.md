📂 Payment apps landscape
===

💬 PollyWeb advocates for payment simplicity for the benefit of users:

- Inversion of control in the available payment options;
    - i.e., consumers may always use their home payment provider, regardless of the country they are traveling to for holidays.
- Inversion of control in financial fees;
    - i.e., consumers are offered all payment options with different financial fees, and will assume responsibility for the additional fees;
    - this is similar to difference fees when a user is selecting an e-commerce delivery option.

This inversion of control requires the understanding of several market forces, e.g.:

- technology available on smartphones (e.g., contactless);
- existing legal agreements with and between banks and card brands;
- existing central government-own platforms, like in Brazil and India;
- successful adoption of new interfaces by consumers and businesses.
