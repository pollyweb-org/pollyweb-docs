🛒 Shopping landscape

🎯 Digital commerce, while ubiquitous for consumers, faces a number of challenges.

- For businesses:
    - Building and maintaining both a website and a mobile app is hard;
    - Multiple resellers result in many registrations of each product;
    - Advertising a product requires a different registration on each platform;

- For consumers:
    - Searching for a product requires opening multiple apps (one per seller).

- These challenges result in a global market with a small number of dominant resellers and platforms. 

- WeChat in 🇨🇳 China and ONDC in 🇮🇳 India appear to be exceptions, but in practice their solutions are still a centralized form of aggregation.

💬 PollyWeb advocates for an inversion of control somewhat similar to India's ONDC:
- sellers fan out their offers once to any interested reseller or advertiser;
- consumers use a single app to find any product from any seller;
- sellers control the user experience with commands sent to the app.
