🕵 Data gathering landscape
===

🎯 Data is a precondition for innovation, allowing organizations to:
- train artificial intelligence;
- find the right audience for advertising;
- implementing national scoring systems for finance, insurance, drivers licenses, and social credit.

🤔 However, data misuse is a concern to society.
- News on the amount and unauthorized usage of data abound (e.g., NSA, Cambridge Analytica).
- Governments worldwide responded with regulation to protect their citizens privacy (e.g., GDPR).
- Next, governments asked for physical locally-managed data residency (e.g., sovereignty clouds).

💬 PollyWeb advocates for the benefits of data gathering without misuse, by combining:
- **global sharing of real-time data**, via tech-agnostic subscriptions; and
- **sovereignty control to data owners**, with transparent sharing policies.
