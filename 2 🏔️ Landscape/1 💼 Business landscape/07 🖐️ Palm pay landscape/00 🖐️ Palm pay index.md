💬 PollyWeb advocates for payment simplicity for the benefit of users, while looking to ensure the following safeguards:

- A consumer's palm should only be matched to their payment methods by entities that already hold the consumer's Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- For business that don't know the consumer, there should be an intermediary (trusted by both the consumer and the business) that obfuscates the matching to protect the consumer's privacy.
