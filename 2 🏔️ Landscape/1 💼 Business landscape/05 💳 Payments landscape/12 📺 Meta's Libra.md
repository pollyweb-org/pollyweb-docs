---

In 2021, CNBC International (a U.S.-based news channel) published the following video, titled *"How the Facebook digital currency dream has changed | CNBC Reports"*.

- The video talks about how the Facebook-backed Diem Association planed to launch a new stable coin tied to the U.S. dollar in 2021. 
- Formerly known as Libra, the digital currency project faced years of pushback from regulators, with key figures deeming the project a failure months after the first white paper launched. 
- In early 2022, the Diem Association announced the sale of its assets to Silvergate Capital Corporation, a bank specializing in cryptocurrency.
- Meta shifted focus to other fintech initiatives, like Novi, a digital wallet, which was later discontinued in 2022.
