===

📺 In this chapter, you will learn:

- How much data is being collected and used by governments, e.g.:

    - in the 🇺🇸 United States:
        - by the [National Security Agency (NSA)](<01 📺 🇺🇸 PRISM scandal.md>) with PRISM, an international surveillance program publicly disclosed by Edward Snowden;
        - and by Facebook, used by [Cambridge Analytica](<02 📺 Cambridge Analytica.md>) to influence in elections and referendums in 🇹🇹 Trinidad and Tobago, the 🇬🇧 United Kingdom, and the 🇺🇸 United States;
    - in 🇨🇳 China:
        - by the nation's [Sharp Eyes](<03 📺 🇨🇳 SharpEyes project.md>) project, used to implement China's social credit system;
        - and hypothetically by [Huawei](<04 📺 Huawei 5G.md>), via worldwide 5G infrastructure, according to the 🇪🇺 European Union and the 🇺🇸 United States.

- How is data gathering regulated, namely:  

    - who governs the 🌐 [Internet](<05 📺 Internet gov.md>);
    - what is 🇨🇳 [China](<06 📺 🇨🇳 China's privacy law.md>)'s data privacy law;
    - what is the 🇪🇺 [European Union](<07 📺 🇪🇺 Europe's GDPR.md>)'s GDPR policy;
    - and how the 🇺🇸 [United States](<08 📺 🇺🇸 NSA data collection.md>) changed NSA data collection.

- How cloud providers are adapting to data residency regulation, e.g.:

    - 🇺🇸 [Microsoft](<09 📺 Sovereignty @ Azure.md>), with the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty;
    - and 🇺🇸 [Amazon](<10 📺 Sovereignty @ AWS.md>), with the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

- What's the future of IT sovereignty, according to 🇺🇸 [Gartner](<11 📺 Sovereignty @ Gartner.md>).
