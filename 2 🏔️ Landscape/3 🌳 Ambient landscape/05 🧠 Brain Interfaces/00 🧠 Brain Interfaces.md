🧠 Brain Interface landscape
===


🎯 Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled with smart glasses would revolutionize the internet by enabling direct brain-to-digital interaction, making AR seamless and hands-free.

💬 NLWeb advocates for transforming all apps into natural language-based systems.
- This would greatly enhance BCI by enabling seamless, intuitive brain-to-app interactions. 
- Instead of complex commands, users could think in natural language. 
- AI-driven context understanding would optimize responses, reducing cognitive load and accelerating BCI adoption.
