🧑‍⚕️ Smart health landscape FAQ
===

🎯 Health data, when is shared timely, has the potential to save lives and extended longevity. 
- 🤔 While current smart watches and fit bands already collect vast amounts of health data about individuals, that data remains siloed in tech companies, medical institutions, or inside the devices that collected them.

📺 In this chapter, you will learn:

- What is smart health, according to [doctors](<01 📺 Doctors' opinion.md>), [hospitals](<02 📺 Hospitals' opinion.md>), [journalists](<03 📺 Journalists' opinion.md>), and [NVIDIA](<04 📺 NVIDIA.md>);
- What are the wearable features offered by [Apple](<05 📺 Apple Watch.md>), [Samsung](<06 📺 Samsung ring.md>), and [Whoop](<07 📺 Whoop wearable.md>);
- [Why](<08 📺 Wearables' data.md>) wearable data should be shared with doctors;
- [How much](<09 📺 Data collection.md>) data is collected by wearables;
- [How many](<10 📺 Data sharing.md>) Americans actually share wearable data with doctors;
- and [what laws](<11 📺 Data regulation.md>) regulate the medical data of individuals.

💬 NLWeb advocates for a combination of:

- 1/ a personal time-series vault for each user;
- 2/ multiple inputs feeding each user's vault;
- 3/ a trusted AI inferring in natural language;
- 4/ medical humans in the loop, validating the insights;
- 5/ user control over who can access the data and when.

Inputs include:

- ⌚ Wearable inputs:
    - Health sensors: heart rate, ECG (Electrocardiogram), blood oxygen levels (SpO₂), skin temperature;
    - Movement sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS location;
    - Environmental sensors: barometric pressure, noise monitoring;
    - Continuous glucose monitors (CGM);

- 🧑‍🦰 User inputs:
    - Text-based: medical history, activity records, mood surveys, report on episodes;
    - Image-based: medical papers, food intake, skin checking;

- 🌳 Ambient inputs:
    - Security devices: smart cameras, smoke detectors;
    - Home appliances: medication and water dispensers, coffee machines, smart TV;

- 👥 Third-party inputs:
    - Gym data: smart scales, cardio equipment, check-in and check-out;
    - Hospital data: medical reports, prescriptions, exam results, vaccination;

- ☁️ Cloud augmented data:
    - Camera streams: image, sound, and speech recognition;
    - Photos: image recognition and transcription;
    - Calculated health metrics: sleep patterns, muscle mass index, health age;
    - Calculated physical activities: hand-washing, accidental fall, car accident;
    - Location-based APIs: weather conditions, geological activity, air quality, environmental pollution, pollen levels, radiation, natural disasters (e.g., wildfires, floods, droughts).
