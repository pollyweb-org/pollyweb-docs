👮 Supervised ID authentication landscape FAQ
===

🎯 Supervised in-person ID authentication/verification is the ability for organizations to confirm, within a supervised environment (e.g., airports), if the holder of a digital credential is the indeed the person to whom the credential was issued to.

- Airports worldwide are leveraging biometrics (e.g., face and iris) to automatically clear travelers against their electronic passports and flight tickets.
- Once verified, travelers can then pass subsequent gates just with their biometrics.
- In Europe, the European Union AI Act restricts such use of citizen biometrics to public services only.

💬 NLWeb's approach is to generalize the user experience at airports to any in-person ID verification, while delegating to public entities the biometric verification step.

- By delegation verifications to users' trusted nations, the ecosystem scales globally.
- Because each nation verifies their citizens, the ecosystem remains law compliant.
