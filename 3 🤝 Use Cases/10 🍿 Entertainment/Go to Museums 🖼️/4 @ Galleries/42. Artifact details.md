1. **How to see artifact descriptions in an art gallery?**

    A user can scan the object's QR code with a wallet, or touch an NFC tag with a device where a wallet is installed (the device must be unlocked):
    - The museum Host domain opens a chat window on the wallet, and writes a description of the artifact on the chat. 
    - The Host already knows what artifact the user is interested in, because the QR/NFC contains both the Host's domain name and a unique locator for the artifact. 
    - Pre-req: install a PollyWeb compatible wallet app.
