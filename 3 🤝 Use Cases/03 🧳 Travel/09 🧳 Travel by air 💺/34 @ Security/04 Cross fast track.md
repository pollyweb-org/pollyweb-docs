1. **How to pass a terminal gate at an airport with a token?**

    Airport terminal gates typically require users to scan their flight tickets to pass 
    - the airport verifies:
        - if the user is in right terminal, 
        - if the ticket is for the day, 
        - and if the flight has not yet departed. 
        
    Traditionally, when using their phones, users could struggle with the phone's screen rotation and brightness. 
    - With NLWeb, users can download their tickets as tokens when checking in, so that they can pass these gates by just tapping the gate with their mobile device.
