💼 Consumer domain role
===

1. **What is a Consumer domain role in PollyWeb?**

    Consumers 💼 
    * are [Host 🤗 domains](<../../Hosts 🤗/🤗 Host role/🤗🎭 Host role.md>) 
    * that request users to share their data,
    * typically to execute a workflow without the user having to type in the data.

1. **What kind of user data is supported by Consumers?**

    Consumers 💼 receive data from the following sources:
    - schema-bound datasets shared directly by users' [Vault 🗄️ domains](<../../Vaults 🗄️/🗄️ Vault/🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>), and
    - downloaded [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) issued by an [Issuer 🎴 domain](<../../Issuers 🎴/🎴 Issuer/🎴🎭 Issuer role.md>) and stored on the Wallet.

    <br/>

1. **How do Consumers receive downloaded Tokens?**

    [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) are shared with Consumers 💼 by [Broker 🤵 domains](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) in a number of ways.

    - **Request on a chat**: 
        - in a [Chat 💬](<../../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>), [Consumers 💼](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) can ask the user to share a specific [Schema 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>);
        - if the user accepts, the [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Wallets 🧑‍🦰/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app/🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>) shares with the [Consumer 💼](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) both the [bound 🔗 Vaults](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Binds 🔗/🔗 Bind.md>) and the downloaded [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) that match that [Schema 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>);
        - e.g., an airline may ask a user to share their passport [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>).

    - **On chat hello**: 
        - when a [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) initiates a chat session with a [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>), it automatically shares the [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) issued by that [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) if the [Token's Schema Code 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>) is marked as SELF;
        - e.g., booking and ticket [Schema Codes 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>) typically allow users to tap on for check-in when arrival at the place of destination, like a restaurant.

    - **When users tap/scan offline Tokens**: 
        - when users tap or scan an offline [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) on a scanner of a [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) (e.g., a printed flight ticket at an airport gate), the [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) can validate the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) without the need for a chat or any interactions with the [user's Broker 🤵 domain](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>).

    - **When users tap Userables**: 
        - when users tap a [Userable 💍](<../../../25 🔆 Locators/Userables 💍/💍💠 Userable thing.md>) on the scanner of a [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) (e.g., a wristband at an airport gate), the [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) can ask the [user's Custodian 🧳 domain](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Custodians 🧳/🧳🫥 Custodian agent.md>) to silently share all [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) marked as public by the user and matching a list of expected [Schema Codes 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>);
        - see [Userable at gates 💍🎬](<../../../25 🔆 Locators/Userables 💍/💍⏩ Userable flows/💍🎬 Cross gates.md>) for details.

    <br/>

1. **Can Consumers use SELF Tokens to tracked domains?**

    Yes. Just like with first-party cookies on Web 2.0 internet. 
    
    - [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) using a [Schema 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>) marked as SELF are silently shared with [Consumer 💼 domains](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>), who can then track users;
    - e.g., a luxury holding company with multiple brands may issue a loyalty card for a specific branded stored, then use that card to track the user across all businesses it manages.

    ---
    <br/>

1. **Can Consumers use SELF Tokens to behave like Vaults?**

    Yes, but that may produce a poor user experience.

    - [SELF Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) are silently shared with Consumers who issued them, the same way the [Locator 🔆](<../../../25 🔆 Locators/Locators 🔆/🔆 Locator.md>) of a user's [Vault 🗄️ domain](<../../Vaults 🗄️/🗄️ Vault/🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) is shared silently with the corresponding [Vault 🗄️ domain](<../../Vaults 🗄️/🗄️ Vault/🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) - this allows for developers to choose either a [Consumer 💼](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) or [Vault 🗄️](<../../Vaults 🗄️/🗄️ Vault/🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) role for personalized features. 
    
    - Domain admins should evaluate the impact of one design decision over another when it comes to how the domain's relationship is presented to the user.

1. **How can Consumers validate the data schema when consuming?**

    When consuming data from a [Vault 🗄️ domain](<../../Vaults 🗄️/🗄️ Vault/🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>), the data envelope indicates the [Schema 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>) and the version (e.g., `any-authority.dom/any-schema:1.0`). 
    
    - The code identifies the [domain Manifest 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>) where the [Schema 🧩](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>) is defined (e.g., `any-schema` is defined in the [domain Manifest 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>) of `any-authority.dom`), so [Consumer 💼 domains](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) can then fetch the schema definitions from a cached [Graph 🕸 domain](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Graphs 🕸/🕸 Graph helper/🕸🤲 Graph helper.md>) or directly from the [Manifest 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>).

    ---
    <br/>

1. **How do Consumers verify a Token's signature?**

    When issuing [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>), the [Issuer 🎴 domains](<../../Issuers 🎴/🎴 Issuer/🎴🎭 Issuer role.md>) sign them with the same key-pair used in their [DKIM 📺](<../../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/2 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/08 🔐 Passwordless ID landscape/07 📺 Email DKIM.md>) public key. 
    - Other [domains 👥](<../../../40 👥 Domains/👥 Domain/👥 Domain.md>) can use the [DKIM 📺](<../../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/2 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/08 🔐 Passwordless ID landscape/07 📺 Email DKIM.md>) key to verify the signature on the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>).

    ---
    <br/>

1. **Can Consumers verify Tokens when Issuers are offline?**

    Yes. 
    
    - PollyWeb advocates for domains to ask [Graph 🕸 domains](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Graphs 🕸/🕸 Graph helper/🕸🤲 Graph helper.md>) for the [DKIM 📺](<../../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/2 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/08 🔐 Passwordless ID landscape/07 📺 Email DKIM.md>) of the [Issuer 🎴 domain](<../../Issuers 🎴/🎴 Issuer/🎴🎭 Issuer role.md>) when verifying [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>). 

    ---
    <br/>

1. **Can Consumers verify Tokens when Issuers rotate a DKIM?**

    [Graph 🕸 domains](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Graphs 🕸/🕸 Graph helper/🕸🤲 Graph helper.md>) will find the [DKIM 📺](<../../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/2 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/08 🔐 Passwordless ID landscape/07 📺 Email DKIM.md>) of the [Issuer 🎴 domain](<../../Issuers 🎴/🎴 Issuer/🎴🎭 Issuer role.md>) that was in use when the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) was issued.

    ---
    <br/>

1. **How are Consumers protected when Graph are compromised by attackers?**

    [Firewall 🔥 domains](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Firewalls 🔥/🔥🤲 Firewall helper.md>) monitor the behavior of any [Graph 🕸 domain](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Graphs 🕸/🕸 Graph helper/🕸🤲 Graph helper.md>) and match domain information with other [Graphs 🕸](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Graphs 🕸/🕸 Graph helper/🕸🤲 Graph helper.md>). 
    * If necessary, [Firewall 🔥 domains](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Firewalls 🔥/🔥🤲 Firewall helper.md>) immediately revoke a Graph's [trust 🫡](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Trusts 🫡/🫡 Domain Trust.md>).

    ---
    <br/>

1. **Why aren't all Tokens validated online?**

    In scenarios where physical gates need to allow for large influx of people (e.g., a concert or a subway station), it is quicker to validate the [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) offline at the edge, opening the gate if the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) seems valid. 
    
    * The [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) may then perform an asynchronous validation of the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>), marking it as expired in a local database so that the passage is blocked on the next pass.

    ---
    <br/>

1. **Can Consumers verify if a Token was issued to the holder?**

    Yes. 
    
    - Certain scenarios require the [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) to verify if the person holding the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) is the person to whom the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) was issue to - e.g.:
        - at an airport border control, automatic gates need to match the face of the passport holder with the biometric signature contained in the electronic passport. 
    
    - This requires an online request to an [Identifier 🆔 domain](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>) that is [bound 🔗](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Binds 🔗/🔗 Bind.md>) to the user and [trusted 🫡](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Trusts 🫡/🫡 Domain Trust.md>) by the [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>), allowing the token to be matched to the holder without disclosing the holder's identity to the [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>):
        - e.g., while entering a casino, the casino can validate that the 21-years-old token is valid, and that the holder is the owner of the token, without knowing who the holder is. 
    
    - The [Identifier 🆔 domain](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>) can perform the authentication:
        - on the user's device (e.g., via multi-factor authentication or using the camera in the device), 
        - or through an external device (e.g., [Amazon One 📺](<../../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/07 🖐️ Palm pay landscape/02 📺 Amazon One.md>) palm reader).


    Consider the following [Chat 💬](<../../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>) as an example. 

    | [Domain](<../../../40 👥 Domains/👥 Domain/👥 Domain.md>) | [Prompt](<../../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/🤔 Prompt.md>) | [User](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Wallets 🧑‍🦰/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app/🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>)
    | - | - | - |
    | 🎰 Casino   | ℹ️ Request for minimum age. [+]
    | 🆔 [Identifier](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>) | 🫥 Share over 21? [Yes, No]      | > Yes
    | 🆔 [Identifier](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>) | 🫥 Let me see if it's you.   | [📸 selfie](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔⏩ Identifier flows/6 Face scan 🆔⏩😶/6 🆔⏩😶 Face scan.md>)
    | 🎰 Casino   | ✅ Welcome, please enter!

1. **How do sellers prevent swapping of identity Tokens?**

    [Seller 💵 domains](<../../Sellers 💵/💵 Seller /💵🎭 Seller role.md>) can prevent frauds where users share their [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) with someone else.
    - e.g., an adult may give their wallet's device to an under-aged child so that they can buy age-restricted goods at a self-service store. 
    
    In low-budget validations, 
    - [Seller 💵 domains](<../../Sellers 💵/💵 Seller /💵🎭 Seller role.md>) ask the user's trusted [Identifier 🆔 domain](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>) to perform the authentication inside the [Chat 💬](<../../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>) on the user's device;
    - depending on the circumstances, this can be a biometric face scan, voice recognition, OTP, security questions, or other. 
    
    In offline scenarios, 
    - where users carry an NFC card or a printed QR, 
    - the [Seller 💵 domain](<../../Sellers 💵/💵 Seller /💵🎭 Seller role.md>) takes a photo of the user with a fixed camera, and then asks the [Token's Identifier 🆔 domain](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>) to match the [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) with the picture.

1. **How are consumers prevented from collecting too much user data?**

    To protect users from [Consumer 💼 domains](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) that collect too much Personally Identifiable Information (PII), [Broker 🤵 domains](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) verify if any [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) request is explicitly mentioned on their [domain Manifest 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>).

    * [Consumer 💼 domains](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) must publicly manifest their potential sharing requests in their [domain Manifest 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>), in a similar way apps must manifest it when publishing into Apple's App Store or Google Play.
    
    * [Consumer 💼 domains](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) manifest the unique contexts in which they will collect data, and what data is collected in each context.
  
    * When interacting in a [Chat 💬](<../../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>), [Consumer 💼 domains](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) need to notify the [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) of a context change before requesting data under that context.

    * [Broker 🤵 domains](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) only process sharing requests that are publicly manifested in advance.

    * [Broker 🤵 domains](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) inform users of every context change, identifying the data that may be collected, then block any data request from the Consumer that does not comply with that context - e.g., [Order pizza 🍕](<../../../../3 🤝 Use Cases/02 🍲 Eat & Drink/70 🍕 Order pizza/21 🏠 Home: Order pizza.md>), [Hotel check-in 🛎️](<../../../../3 🤝 Use Cases/03 🧳 Travel/08 🧳 Stay at hotels 🏨/03 🏨 Guest @ Reception 🛎️/04 🛎️ Check-in.md>).

    * Because the [domain Manifests 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>) are public and prone to automatic evaluation by domains like [Firewall 🔥 domains](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Firewalls 🔥/🔥🤲 Firewall helper.md>) and [Reviewer ⭐ domains](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Reviewers ⭐/⭐ Reviewer agent/⭐ Reviewer 🫥 agent.md>), [Consumer 💼 domains](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) are exposed to public scrutiny regarding the data  their are collecting, namely: what, why, how, and how much.

    * [Authority 🏛️ domains](<../../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Authorities 🏛️/🏛️🤲 Authority helper.md>) monitor the [domain Manifests 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>) for dataset requests that don't match the domain's business or exception requests, and if necessary may revoke the [trust 🫡](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Trusts 🫡/🫡 Domain Trust.md>) on the [Consumer 💼 domain](<💼🎭 Consumer role.md>).

    * Consider the following example of a [domain Manifests 📜](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>).
    
        ```yaml
        Flows:

            check-in-flow: 
                Title: Check-in
                Details: <long optional description>
                Steps:
                  - Input: SHARE pollyweb.org/IDENTITY/ID
                    Purpose: your identity 🆔 shares your ID
                  - Input: SHARE pollyweb.org/CURATOR/CURATE
                    Purpose: your curator 🧚 sets the room 
                  - Input: CHARGE
                    Purpose: your payer 💳 pays the stay
                  - Input: ISSUE|any-hotel.dom/KEY
                    Purpose: your broker 🤵 saves the room key 
        ```

    
    * That configuration would result in the following [Chat 💬](<../../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>) excerpt. 

        | [Domain](<../../../40 👥 Domains/👥 Domain/👥 Domain.md>) | [Prompt](<../../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/🤔 Prompt.md>) | [User](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Wallets 🧑‍🦰/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app/🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>)
