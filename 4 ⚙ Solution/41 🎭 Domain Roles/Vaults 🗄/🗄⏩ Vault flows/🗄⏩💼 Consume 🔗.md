## FAQ

1. **Why do Consumers and Vaults check Trusts again?**

    `Liability` [Brokers 🤵](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/3 🤵 Brokers/🤵🤲 Broker helper.md>) do not assume legal responsibility for orchestration faults.
    * [Broker 🤵 domains](<../../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/3 🤵 Brokers/🤵🤲 Broker helper.md>) can be compromised or make mistakes.
    * [Vault 🗄️ domains](<../🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) are ultimately responsible for data breaches.
    * [Consumer 💼 domains](<../../Consumers 💼/💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) are ultimately responsible for interacting with banned entities (e.g., entities listed as terrorist groups).
    * [Consumer 💼 domains](<../../Consumers 💼/💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) and [Vault 🗄️ domains](<../🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) should revalidate the [Trust 👍](<../../../40 👥 Domains/👥👍 Domain Trusts/👍 Domain Trust.md>) path for their own protection whenever feasible.

1. **Why Consume+Collect instead of a single call?**

    `Time` [Vault 🗄️ domains](<../🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) may need time to gather the data, from seconds to days.
    * Thus, [Consumer 💼 domains](<../../Consumers 💼/💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) need to wait for [Vault 🗄️ domains](<../🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) to notify them when the data is ready.
    * This is the [`Consume@Consumer`](<../../Consumers 💼/💼🅰️ Consumer methods/🗄️🐌💼 Consume.md>) call.

    `Size` Pushing a payload has size limits, while downloading it doesn't.
    * Thus, to allow [Consumer 💼 domains](<../../Consumers 💼/💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) to download data sets from [Vault 🗄️ domains](<../🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) via with no theoretical size limit, the request needs to come from the [Consumer 💼 domain](<../../Consumers 💼/💼🎭 Consumer role.md>) (and not from the [Vault 🗄️ domain](<../🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>)).
    * This is the [`Collect@Vault`](<../🗄️🅰️ Vault methods/💼🚀🗄️ Collect.md>) call.
