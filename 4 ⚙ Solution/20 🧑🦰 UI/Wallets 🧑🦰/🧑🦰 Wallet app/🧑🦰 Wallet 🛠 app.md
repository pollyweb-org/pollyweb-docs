1. **What permissions are required on the device?**

    - Localization settings (for translations)
    - Country location (for fraud prevention)
    - Geographical coordinates (for real-time workflows)    
    - Rear camera (for scanning)
    - Front camera (for identity verification)

1. **What happens when users install an NLWeb Wallet?**

    On its first use, [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 apps](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>):
    1. create a key-pair for user and store it in the secure area of the device;
        - e.g., in Android, this is the high-level behavior of [passkeys 📺](<../../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/2 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/08 🔐 Passwordless ID landscape/03 📺 Google passkeys.md>);
    2. register the user's public half of the key-pair in the [Wallet's Notifier 📣 domain](<../../Notifiers 📣/📣 Notifier domain/📣 Notifier 👥 domain.md>);
    3. store locally the wallet ID returned by the [Notifier 📣 domain](<../../Notifiers 📣/📣 Notifier domain/📣 Notifier 👥 domain.md>).

    ---
    <br/>

1. **What data exists in the device at any given time?**

    The only data that [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 apps](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>) store locally is:
    - 🔏 The private half of the key pair;
    - 📣 The Wallet ID provided by the [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../Brokers 🤵/🤵 Broker helper/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) via the [Notifier 📣 domain](<../../Notifiers 📣/📣 Notifier domain/📣 Notifier 👥 domain.md>);
    - 🎫 Downloaded [Tokens 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>) from [Issuer 🎴 domains](<../../../41 🎭 Domain Roles/Issuers 🎴/🎴 Issuer/🎴🎭 Issuer role.md>).

1. **Do wallets work after backing up and restoring a phone?**

    Yes. 
    - If the OS of the old phone is backed up and restored on another Android or iOS phone, then nothing else is required given that the key-pair of the [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>) isn't dependent on any hardware key, and is stored on the OS Vault.

1. **How do users migrate a Wallet to another phone?**

    To migrate a [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>) to another phone, a user first needs to bind an [Identity 🆔 agent domain](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identities 🆔/🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) on the old phone, and then generate a migration QR [Token 🎫](<../../../30 🧩 Data/Tokens 🎫/🎫 Token/🎫 Token.md>).
    
    * On the new phone, the user needs to install a [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>), then scan the migration QR of the old Wallet.
    * The [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../Brokers 🤵/🤵 Broker helper/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) will invoke the [Identity 🆔 domain](<../../../50 🫥 Agent domains/Identities 🆔/🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) on the new phone to perform an identity authentication (e.g., face scan), and then will automatically decommission the old Wallet.

1. **How do users change between Wallet providers?**

    If both the old and the new [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>) providers use the same [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../Brokers 🤵/🤵 Broker helper/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>), 
    * then changing between Wallet providers in the same phone is very similar to migrating a Wallet to another phone. 
    
    If they use different [Broker 🤵 domains](<../../Brokers 🤵/🤵 Broker helper/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>), 
    * then these Brokers will need to implement some sort of portability. 
     
    For simplicity, let's assume they use the same [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../Brokers 🤵/🤵 Broker helper/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>).
    
    * On the old [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>), the user generates a migration QR Token and downloads it or sends it to another person. 
    * Then, on the new [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>), the user uploads or scans the migration QR and performs an identity authentication (e.g., face scan).

    <br/>

1. **What if an attacker intercepts a user's recovery QR Token?**

    When a migration QR is used on a new [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>), the [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../Brokers 🤵/🤵 Broker helper/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) notifies the old Wallet, allowing legitimate owners to block the attack and destroy the QR. 
    
    * For situations where legitimate owners are not aware of notifications, migrations have a small grace period where [Broker 🤵 domains](<../../Brokers 🤵/🤵 Broker helper/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) inactivate both Wallets until the old Wallet accepts the transfer or the grace period expires.

    ---
    <br/>

1. **After destroying a migration QR, how can users migrate?**

    Just generate a new migration QR.

    ---
    <br/>

1. **After losing a phone, how do users recover a wallet on a new phone?**

    If the old phone is not available, then users need an offline migration QR previously printed or saved as an image - without it, it's not possible to recover the Wallet. 
    
    * On the new phone, users install a [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>), scan or upload the QR, perform an identity authentication, and wait for the grace period.

    ---
    <br/>

1. **What if an attacker has the user's old phone and rejects the transfer?**

    After a successful identity authentication on the new phone, blocking the migration from the old phone will also require a successful identity authentication. 

    * This way, an attacker in the possession of the old phone will not be able to stop the migration to the legitimate user.
