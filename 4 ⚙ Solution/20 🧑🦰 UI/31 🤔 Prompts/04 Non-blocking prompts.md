1. **How do non-blocking options work?**
   
    Non-blocking prompts support [ONE 1️⃣ prompt](<25 1️⃣ ONE prompt.md>) options.
    - If it contains options, then the user may click an option any time before or after the [Host 🤗 domain](<../12 💬 Chats/04 🤗🎭 Host role.md>) sends other subsequent [Prompts 🤔](<01 🤔 Prompt.md>).
