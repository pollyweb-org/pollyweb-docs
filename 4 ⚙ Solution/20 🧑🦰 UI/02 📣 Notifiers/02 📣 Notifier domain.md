1. **What is a Notifier domain in NLWeb?**

    A Notifier is a backend-for-frontend (BFF) domain that acts as a proxy for a [Wallet 🧑‍🦰](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>). 
    
    * This allows other domains to communicate in standard HTTPS with the Notifier 📣, while the Notifier 📣 communicates via mobile-friendly real-time protocols with the [Wallet 🧑‍🦰](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) (e.g., MQTT, web sockets, mobile notifications). 
    
    * Because of this tight integration between Notifiers 📣 and [Wallets 🧑‍🦰](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>), NLWeb advocates for them to be built and managed by the same team.

1. **Do Notifiers store user data?**

    Not for NLWeb. 
    
    * In NLWeb, domain orchestration is done by [Broker 🤵](<../03 🤵 Brokers/03 🤵 Broker domain.md>) domains, and storage of user data is done by [Vault 🗄️](<../24 🗄️ Vaults/03 🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>) domains, while a Notifier's 📣 only responsibility is to proxy messages to and from the [Broker 🤵](<../03 🤵 Brokers/03 🤵 Broker domain.md>). 
    
    * This is by design, allowing resilient [Broker 🤵](<../03 🤵 Brokers/03 🤵 Broker domain.md>) implementations (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) to assume the complexity of the undifferentiated NLWeb protocol, while allowing app start-ups to focus on user experience differentiation. 
    
    * Of course, companies developing [Wallets](<../01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) may wish to support unique features not supported by [Broker 🤵](<../03 🤵 Brokers/03 🤵 Broker domain.md>), which may eventually result in the need to store user data on the Notifier 📣.
