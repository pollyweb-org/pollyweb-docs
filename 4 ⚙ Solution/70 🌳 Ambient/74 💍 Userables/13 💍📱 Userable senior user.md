1. **How can a confused senior user leverage their Userables?**

    Consider a scenario where a senior person is returning home alone and accidentally leaves their bag 👜 on a taxi 🚖, with the home keys and the phone inside in silent mode.
    * Because the phone is in silent mode, its useless to call the phone.
    * Nowadays, we don't memorize phone numbers, so the person can't call a relative.
    * FindMy apps (e.g., Apple) and [UWB tags 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/3 🌳 Ambient landscape/02 🔑 Smart Keys/11 📺 Apple Key UWB.md>)  can't help, because the owner typically needs another of his authenticated devices (e.g., a phone, a tablet, or laptop).

    With NLWeb, the person can ask anyone else (e.g., the staff from a restaurant nearby) to use their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) and [tap 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/11 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) one of the person's [Userable 💍 things](<$ 💍 Userable thing.md>) (e.g., wedding ring, neckless, watch) in order to:
    - read their landing notes for memory tips, 
    - authenticate to access their owner area (e.g., face scan),
    - call any of their emergency contacts,
    - see the current location of their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) (like Apple Find My), 
    - and remotely ring their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) (like Apple Find My).

1. **How does it work?**

    ![](<. 📎 Assets/💍 Userable Phone.png>)

    |#|Category|Step|
    |-|-|-
    |1| `Tap` | A guest user uses their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) to [tap 🔆](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/11 🔆 Locators/04 🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) the [rotating NFC tag 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/11 📺 NFC authentication.md>) of the owner's [Userable 💍 thing](<$ 💍 Userable thing.md>). 
    |2| `Read`| The guest's [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../45 🛠️ Helper domains/24 🤵 Brokers/$ 🤵 Broker domain.md>) opens a [Chat 💬](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/12 💬 Chats/$ 💬 Chat.md>) with the [Userable's Wand 🪄 domain](<../../45 🛠️ Helper domains/90 🪄 Wands/$ 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>), allowing the guest user to read the landing notes that the owner user left.
    |3| `Admin` | The guest user asks the [Userable's Wand 🪄 domain](<../../45 🛠️ Helper domains/90 🪄 Wands/$ 🪄🛠️ Wand helper.md>) to access the owner's admin area, who then directs the request to the [owner's Custodian 🧳 agent](<../../50 🫥 Agents/35 🧳 Custodians/$ 🧳🫥 Custodian agent.md>).
    |4| `Face` | The [owner's Custodian 🧳 agent](<../../50 🫥 Agents/35 🧳 Custodians/$ 🧳🫥 Custodian agent.md>) asks the [owner's Identity 🆔 agent](<../../50 🫥 Agents/45 🆔 Identities/$ 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) to authenticate the owner with a [face scan 😶](<../../50 🫥 Agents/45 🆔 Identities/21 🆔😶 Face scan.md>) using the guest's [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>).
    |5| `Ring` |  The [owner's Custodian 🧳 agent](<../../50 🫥 Agents/35 🧳 Custodians/$ 🧳🫥 Custodian agent.md>) then informs the owner about the location of owner's [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>), and allows them to remotely ring the [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/01 🧑‍🦰 Wallets/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>). 
    |6| `Circle` | The owner can then access the contact details of their personal circle via the [owner's Custodian 🧳 agent](<../../50 🫥 Agents/35 🧳 Custodians/$ 🧳🫥 Custodian agent.md>).
