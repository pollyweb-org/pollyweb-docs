1. **How do Persona vaults differ from Identifier vaults?**

    [Persona 🧢 vaults](<🧢🫥 Persona agent.md>) are controlled by users, allowing them to define their preferences according to specific circumstances (e.g., a user may have different preferences when traveling for work or on family holidays). 
    
    - Conversely, [Identifier 🆔 vaults](<../../Identifiers 🆔/🆔 Identifier agent/🆔 Identifier 🫥 agent.md>)  are controlled by nations on behalf of their citizens (e.g., the UK), allowing users to legally identity themselves at home and abroad.

1. **Can users leverage their social network instead?**

    Yes. A [Persona 🧢](<🧢🫥 Persona agent.md>) is a PollyWeb role that can be implemented by any social network. Thus, once the user's social network onboards to PollyWeb as a Persona, users can use it.
