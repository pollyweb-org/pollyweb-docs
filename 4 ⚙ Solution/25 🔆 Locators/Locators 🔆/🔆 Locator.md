## FAQ

1. **What are Locators?**

    In PollyWeb, non-humans (e.g., organizations, places, objects, animals) are represented by a [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>) that opens a [Chat 💬](<../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>) with a [Host 🤗 domain](<../../41 🎭 Domain Roles/Hosts 🤗/🤗 Host role/🤗🎭 Host role.md>).
    * It may be a [QR code ✨](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰✨ Wallet QR scan.md>), an [NFC tag 🔆](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>), a [Web link 🌐](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰🌐 Wallet URLs.md>), or a [Chat 💬](<../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>) option.
    * Users can [tap 🔆](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>), [scan ✨](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰✨ Wallet QR scan.md>), [click 🌐](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰🌐 Wallet URLs.md>), or [select 💬](<../../35 💬 Chats/Chats 💬/💬 Chat.md>) them.

1. **What data is contained in a Locator?**

    A [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>) is a string 
    * formatted as `{code},{domain},{key}[,{fields}]`
  
    For example:
    * `.HOST,any-domain.dom,ANY-KEY,A=1,B=2`
    * `pollyweb.org/ALIAS:1.0,any-printer.dom,ANY-KEY`
    

    |Component| Examples | Purpose
    |-|-|-
    | `Schema` |  `.HOST` | [Schema 🧩](<../../30 🧩 Data/Codes 🧩/🧩 Schema Code.md>) for [`Schema@Graph`](<../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Graphs 🕸/🕸📨 Graph msgs/👥🚀🕸 Schema/🕸 Schema 🚀 call.md>)
    | `Domain` | `any-host.dom` | [Domain 👥](<../../40 👥 Domains/👥 Domain/👥 Domain.md>) for a [Broker 🤵](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) to interact 
    | `Key` | `product-1234` | Resource key in the [Host 🤗 domain](<../../41 🎭 Domain Roles/Hosts 🤗/🤗 Host role/🤗🎭 Host role.md>)
    | `Properties` | `A=1,B=2` | Any optional data fields

1. **Can Locators be forged?**

    Yes. 
    
    - Thread agents may replace authentic Locators 🔆 fake ones for a number of reasons, e.g.:
        - in **business impersonation attacks**, an attacker replaces the QR/NFC/URL of a business, impersonating it to drive users into [data phishing 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/06 📺 QR phishing.md>) and/or fraudulent transactions using a credible brand; 
        - in **misplacement attacks**, an attacker may want access to door A, so it moves the NFC/QR of door A to door B and then waits by door A - a user trying to open door B will actually open door A instead. 
  

    - Forging Locators 🔆 may be done in multiple ways, e.g.:
        - [QR codes ✨](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰✨ Wallet QR scan.md>) are typically forged with an overlay on top of the original code;
        - [NFC tags 🔆](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) are typically forged with a replacement of the original tag;
        - [URL links 🌐](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰🌐 Wallet URLs.md>) are typically forged with malicious javascript on the browser;
        - new fake NFC/QR Locators 🔆 may placed strategically near the target services (e.g., in pillars of a parking lot).

1. **How can users detect business impersonation attacks?**

    User's best option to detect whether a [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>) is genuine or fake, is to see if it opens their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Wallets 🧑‍🦰/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app/🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>) or if it opens a web page.

    - If it opens their [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Wallets 🧑‍🦰/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app/🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>), then they'll know that all messages will safely go through a trustworthy [Broker 🤵 domain](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>).
    - Instead, if the [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>) opens a web page, then it's most probably not a PollyWeb [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>).
    - Exceptionally, users will be directed to the `pollyweb.org` website if they do not have a [Wallet 🧑‍🦰 app](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Wallets 🧑‍🦰/🧑‍🦰 Wallet app/🧑‍🦰 Wallet 🛠️ app.md>) installed on their smartphone.

    Given that the [Wallet's Broker 🤵 domain](<../../20 🧑‍🦰 UI/Brokers 🤵/🤵/🤵 Broker 🤲 helper.md>) serves as a protector, user can trust its mechanism to protect them from [phishing sites 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/06 📺 QR phishing.md>), just like Google Chrome does with [SSL certificate validation 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/08 📺 Google's Risk API.md>) and other phishing detection/blocking features - these mechanisms include:

    - [Messages 📨](<../../30 🧩 Data/Messages 📨/📨 Message/📨 Message.md>) can only flow through encrypted channels with cross-authentication of both sender and receiver domains;
    - Data exchange can only be performed between domains that publicly [Trust 🫡](<../../30 🧩 Data/Trusts 🫡/🫡 Domain Trust.md>) one another or are trusted by mutually trusted [Authority 🏛️ domains](<../../45 🤲 Helper domains/Authorities 🏛️/🏛️🤲 Authority helper.md>), following the principle of least-privilege;
    - User inputs can only be collected if the intention is clearly mentioned in a [domain Manifest 📜](<../../30 🧩 Data/Manifests 📜/📜 Manifest/📜 Manifest.md>) subject to public scrutiny.

1. **How can businesses be protected by misplacement attacks?**
    
    Businesses can implement the following security mechanisms for misplacement attacks, where an attacker replaces a genuine [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>) A for another genuine [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>) B in order to trick a user to unlock the resource B instead of the resource A:

    - deploy read-only [rotating NFC tags 📺](<../../../2 🏔️ Landscape/1 💼 Business landscape/11 🔆 Scanning landscape/11 📺 NFC authentication.md>) without a QR code;
    - deploy [Ephemeral 🦋 devices](<../../60 🧰 Edge/62 🦋 Ephemerals/03 🦋🔌 Ephemeral device.md>) that emulates both a [QR code ✨](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰✨ Wallet QR scan.md>) and an [NFC tag 🔆](<🔆⏩ Locator flows/🧑‍🦰🔆 Wallet NFC tap.md>) with a [Locator 🔆](<🔆 Locator.md>) that rotates every X seconds.
