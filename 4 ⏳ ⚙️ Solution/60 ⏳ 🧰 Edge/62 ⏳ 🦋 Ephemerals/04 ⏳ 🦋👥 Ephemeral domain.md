    An Ephemeral 🦋 domain is a [Supplier 🏭](<../../30 ⏳ 🫥 Agents/06 ✅ 🛎️ Concierges/02 ✅ 🏭🎭 Supplier role.md>) of Ephemeral that allow other domains to buy devices. 
    * It handles the orders, delivery, and management of the devices on behalf of the buyer.
    * When a user taps/scans an Ephemeral 🦋 locator, the Ephemeral domain does the translation on behalf of the buyer domain, and triggers the internal locator of the buyer domain.
