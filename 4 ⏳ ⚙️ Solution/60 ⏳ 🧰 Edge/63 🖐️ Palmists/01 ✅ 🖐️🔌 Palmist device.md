    ![](<📎 Assets/🖐️ Palm Scanner.png>)

    Palm vein scanners are biometric [Pluggable 🔌](<../61 ✅ 🔌 Pluggables/01 ✅ 🔌 Pluggable device.md>) devices that use infrared light to map the unique vein pattern in an individual's palm. 
    * These patterns are highly individualized, making them an effective method for identity verification. 
    * The technology works by shining near-infrared light through the palm; the hemoglobin in the veins absorbs this light, and the scanner captures an image of the vein pattern. 
    * This image is then compared to a stored template for authentication.
