1. **How do Relays differ from Padlocks?**

    While [Padlocks 🔒](<../../70 ✅ 🌳 Ambient/75 ✅ 🔒 Brand Padlocks/01 ✅ 🔒 Padlock device.md>) can also be used to open doors, they differ from Relayers in a number of ways:
    * Proximity - Relayers are global, Padlocks are short range only;
    * Internet - Relayers need internet, Padlocks work offline;
    * Identity - Relayers use [🆔 Identities](<../../30 ⏳ 🫥 Agents/05 ✅ 🆔 Identities/03 ✅ 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>), Padlocks are anonymous;
    * Userables - Relayers support [Userables 💍](<../../70 ✅ 🌳 Ambient/74 ✅ 💍 Brand Userables/01 ✅ 💍 Userable thing.md>), Padlocks don't.
