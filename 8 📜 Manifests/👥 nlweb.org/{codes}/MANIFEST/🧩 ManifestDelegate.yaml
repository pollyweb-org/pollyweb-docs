Name: Domain delegate

Description: >
  Delegated domain for authority-managed codes.
  - It allows for a manifest to be smaller, while keeping the ownership 
    of the code group. For example, (profile.nlweb.org) defines all codes 
    for /PROFILE on behalf of (nlweb.org).
  - The delegated domain must reference the domain of the Delegator, as 
    described in nlweb.org/MANIFEST/CODE.

  Version: 1.0

  Properties:
    - Delegate  # Domain to delegate to - e.g. profile.nlweb.org (string)
    - Code      # Relative path of the code or group - e.g. /PROFILE (string)
