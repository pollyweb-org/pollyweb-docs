1. **How to use a show ticket to enter and find the seat?**

    Upon arrival at the venue, users tap/scan the NFC/QR in a handheld device hold by the person at the door 
    - the door person welcomes the user; 
    - alternatively, if the user has an image or a printed version of the ticket's QR, the door person can scan the QR with their device. 
    
    While walking through the venue, users tap/scan the NFC/QR in the venue's objects (e.g., chairs, doors) 
    - a chat opens with directions from there to their seat and to the nearest toilet, and the time left until the show starts. 
    
    Once the seat is found, users tap/scan the seats' NFC/QR 
    - a chat opens confirming they are in the right seat.
