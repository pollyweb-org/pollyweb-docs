1. **What is a Wand domain in NLWeb?**

    ![](<./00 ✅ 📎 Assets/💠 Wand.png>)

    Wands are [Suppliers 🏭](<../../30 ⏳ 🫥 Agents/06 ✅ 🛎️ Concierges/02 ✅ 🏭🎭 Supplier role.md>) that create and manage the user chats of [Things 💠](<01 ✅ 💠 Thing.md>) on behalf of [Brands 🍏](<07 ✅ 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>).

1. **Why are Wands important?**

    For domains, Wands remove the overhead for Brands in implementing the NLWeb protocol.
    
    For users, Wands ensure a seamless experience when interacting with Things from any Brand, given that the chat session of a Thing is controlled by the Wand.

1. **Do Wands know which user registered the Locator?**

    No. That is hidden by [Custodians 🎩](<05 ✅ 🎩🗄️ Custodian vault.md>).

1. **Can Brands know which user registered the placeholder?**

    No. That is hidden by [Custodians 🎩](<05 ✅ 🎩🗄️ Custodian vault.md>). 
    
    Of course, [Brands 🍏](<07 ✅ 🍏🎭 Brand role.md>) can find alternative ways to get that information, but those are not part of the NLWeb protocol.

1. **Can a user contact the Brand?**

    Yes, when applicable. 
    
    Brands may provide their contact Locator when placing an order to Wands - in that case, Wands can leverage the Brand domain on behalf of users.

    However, some Brands may not want to provide their contact if they want to remain anonymous - this is common in white-labelling and other branding strategies.

1. **What if a Brand ceases to exist?**

    Wands verify if the Brand is still active upon user interaction. A Wand may decide to keep a Thing working even after the Brand is inactive (e.g., if the user pays a subscription to the Wand).

    ---

1. **How can Wands monetize?**

    Wands may implement a number of ways to monetize:
    - charge Brands for a commitment to keep the placeholder active for a certain amount of time (e.g., 10 years) when an order is placed;
    - charge Custodians for each user registration or interaction with a Thing;
    - charge a subscription to users;
    - introduce advertising in the user chats.
