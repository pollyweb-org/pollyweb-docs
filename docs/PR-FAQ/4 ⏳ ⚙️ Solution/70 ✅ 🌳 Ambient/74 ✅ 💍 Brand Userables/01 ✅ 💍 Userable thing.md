1. **Are Userables trackable, like Apple AirTags?**

    No. NFC Userables use passive NFC, thus requiring a powered reader to come into contact with them, similar to traditional touchless bank cards.

    Conversely, Apple Tags can be trackable because they use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with any Apple device from up to 100 meters away.
