1. **How can users set up a health emergency script?**

    In case the owner is unconscious, any guest can tap the owner's [Userable 💍](<01 ✅ 💍 Userable thing.md>) to start an emergency script previously configured by the owner - these emergency steps may include:
    - inform close family members, 
    - make a group phone call, 
    - notify the health insurance company.
    
    To streamline the process, [Wand 🪄](<../71 ✅ 💠 Brand Things/09 ✅ 🪄🏭 Wand supplier.md>) domains collect the following information from the guest:
    - contact details,
    - current location.

    To avoid harassment frauds, [Wands 🪄](<../71 ✅ 💠 Brand Things/09 ✅ 🪄🏭 Wand supplier.md>) request guests to be authenticated by a [trusted 👍](<../../40 ✅ 👥 Domains/43 ✅ 👍 Trusts/01 ✅ 👍 Domain Trust.md>) [Identity 🆔](<../../30 ⏳ 🫥 Agents/05 ✅ 🆔 Identities/03 ✅ 🆔🫥 Identity agent.md>) domain before issuing the emergency alarm.

    Owners with high risk (e.g., epilepsy, heart disease) may speed up the rescue by adding instructions directly to the landing page and/or by removing the need for guests to authenticate before activating an emergency.
