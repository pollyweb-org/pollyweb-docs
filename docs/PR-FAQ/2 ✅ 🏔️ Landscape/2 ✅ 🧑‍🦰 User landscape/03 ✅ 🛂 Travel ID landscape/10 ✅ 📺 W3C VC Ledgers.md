📺 What are W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) ledgers?
---

In 2022, the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) published the following video, titled *"Verifiable Credentials explained with EBSI"*. 

- EBSI is a European Union initiative aimed at leveraging blockchain technology to enhance cross-border public services. 
- ​The video explains how Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) function within the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI).
- Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital representations of information that can be cryptographically verified to ensure authenticity, integrity, and issuer legitimacy, enabling individuals to prove qualifications, identity, or other attributes without exposing unnecessary personal data.  
- DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are self-owned, globally unique identifiers that enable individuals or organizations to have a digital identity independent of any central authority.
- DIDs provide the foundation for VCs by ensuring that credentials can be issued, verified, and controlled in a decentralized manner.
- Both DIDs and VCs are were created and standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a global organization that develops open web standards.
- [IATA 📺](<05 ✅ 📺 IATA's digital ID.md>) and the [EU Wallet 📺](<../05 ✅ 📂 ID Wallets landscape/01 ✅ 📺 EU Wallet.md>) initially considered using blockchain for their shared VC ledgers, allowing organizations to use it a shared catalog, but later abandoned blockchain and opted for traditional databases.
