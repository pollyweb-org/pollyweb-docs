📺 What is Sir Tim Berners-Lee doing with vaults?
--

In 2021, Simply Explained (a YouTube channel that creates educational videos about science and technology) published the following video, titled *"Solid - A Better Web (Simply Explained)"*.

- The video explains Solid (short for Social Linked Data), a new web standard that puts users in control of their data, sponsored by Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web). 
- Solid allows users to store their data in a "pod" and share it with applications as they choose. 
- Because users can decide if and when to disclose that data to web domains, this can help protect user privacy, level the playing field for developers, and make it easier to switch between services.
