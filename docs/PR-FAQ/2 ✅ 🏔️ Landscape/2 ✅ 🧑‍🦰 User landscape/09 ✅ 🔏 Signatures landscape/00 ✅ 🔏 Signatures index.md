🔏 Digital signatures landscape FAQ

1. **Why are digital signatures important for NLWeb?**


    🎯 Signing contracts is a ubiquitous part of society: 
    - Ink paper signatures (e.g., marriage, business contract, national visa);
    - Scanned signatures (e.g., attached email photo of the ink signature);
    - Electronic signatures on tablets managed by organizations (e.g., car rental);
    - Electronic forms accepting terms (e.g., website cookies);
    - Digital acceptance on a signature platform (e.g., Docusign);
    - Enterprise asymmetric cryptography (e.g., email servers, financial institutions). 
    

    🤔 Since 2000, countries worldwide legalized electronic signatures, allowing contracts to be sent in all of the digital forms mentioned - however, electronic fraud can happen in a number of ways, e.g.:
    - by forging the signature image with generative AI;
    - by impersonating the signer, online or face-to-face;
    - by hijacking the signer's email or social network.


    💬 NLWeb advocates for signatures stamped by a trusted broker, with the following steps:
    - step 1: the business asks the signer to sign the contract file (e.g., an image or PDF);
    - step 2: the signer delegates the signature to a commonly trusted broker;
    - step 3: the broker delegates the biometric authentication to the signer's sovereign nation;
    - step 4: the broker adds an asymmetric-cryptography timestamp to the file's metadata.
