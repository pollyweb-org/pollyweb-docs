---

The following video from 2020, entitled *"The future of business messaging"* envisions a future that is already available in 2024 with WhatsApp for Business using Product Catalogues, Flows, and Payments. 

- Meta's push into conversational commerce, which started around 2018, integrates natural language interactions between businesses and consumers into messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. 

- The goal is to make shopping more seamless by allowing users to ask questions, receive personalized recommendations, and complete purchases directly in chat using NLP. 

- This means users can interact with brands in a conversational, human-like manner, making queries and transactions as easy as regular messaging.

- Meta's long-term goal is to create a frictionless shopping experience, allowing users to interact naturally with businesses, leveraging both conversational AI and the broader metaverse vision.
