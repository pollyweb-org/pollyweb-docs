📺 How to use biometrics for home access?
---

In 2024, Smart Home Solver (a YouTube channel that provides reviews and tutorials on smart home products) published the following video, titled *"I tested 2 NEW Smart Locks, and I’m shocked"*.

- The video reviews two  smart locks: one that scans your palm and another that scans your face. 
- Both locks are found to be convenient and secure, but the face-scanning lock is deemed more convenient overall due to its faster unlocking speed and additional features like rechargeable batteries and Apple Home Key support.
