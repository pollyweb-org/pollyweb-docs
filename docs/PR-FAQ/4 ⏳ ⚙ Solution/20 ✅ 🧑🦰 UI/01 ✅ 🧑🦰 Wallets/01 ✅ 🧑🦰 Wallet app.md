1. **What happens when users install an NLWeb Wallet?**

    On its first use, Wallet apps:
    1. create a key-pair for user and store it in the secure area of the device;
        - e.g., in Android, this is the high-level behavior of [passkeys](<../../../2 ✅ 🏔️ Landscape/2 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/08 ✅ 🔐 Passwordless ID landscape/03 ✅ 📺 Google passkeys.md>);
    1. register the user's public half of the key-pair in the Wallet's [Notifier 📣](<../02 ✅ 📣 Notifiers/02 ✅ 📣 Notifier domain.md>);
    1. store locally the wallet ID returned by the [Notifier 📣](<../02 ✅ 📣 Notifiers/02 ✅ 📣 Notifier domain.md>).

1. **What data exists in the device at any given time?**

    The only data that [Wallets 🧑‍🦰](<01 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) store locally is:
    - 🔏 The private half of the key pair;
    - 📣 The Wallet ID provided by the [Notifier 📣](<../02 ✅ 📣 Notifiers/02 ✅ 📣 Notifier domain.md>);
    - 🎫 Downloaded [Tokens 🎫](<../27 ✅ 🎫 Tokens/01 ✅ 🎫 Token.md>) from [Issuers 🎴](<../27 ✅ 🎫 Tokens/02 ✅ 🎴🎭 Issuer role.md>).

1. **Do wallets work after backing up and restoring a phone?**

    Yes. 
    - If the OS of the old phone is backed up and restored on another Android or iOS phone, then nothing else is required given that the [Wallet's 🧑‍🦰](<01 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 Wallet app.md>) key-pair isn't dependent on any hardware key, and is stored on the OS Vault.
