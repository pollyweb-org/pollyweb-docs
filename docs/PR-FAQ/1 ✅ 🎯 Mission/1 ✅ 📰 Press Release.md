📰 Press release
===

Octan announced the release of the Natural Language Web (NLWeb) specification, an internet layer that allows humans and their AI assistants to interact in natural language with non-humans (e.g., organizations, places, objects, and animals). By clicking, tapping, or scanning an [NLWeb locator](<../2 ✅ 🏔️ Landscape/1 ✅ 💼 Business landscape/11 ✅ 🔆 Scanning landscape/00 ✅ 🔆 Scanning index.md>) with a ubiquitous [chat app](<../2 ✅ 🏔️ Landscape/1 ✅ 💼 Business landscape/10 ✅ 💬 Chatting landscape/00 ✅ 💬 Chatting index.md>), users can now [share](<../2 ✅ 🏔️ Landscape/2 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/02 ✅ 🧢 Personalization landscape/00 ✅ 🧢 Personalization index.md>) their online data, present offline [credentials](<../2 ✅ 🏔️ Landscape/2 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 User landscape/04 ✅ 🆔 Digital ID landscape/00 ✅ 🆔 Digital ID index.md>), ask questions, fill out forms, execute workflows, [pay](<../2 ✅ 🏔️ Landscape/1 ✅ 💼 Business landscape/05 ✅ 💳 Payments landscape/00 ✅ 💳 Payments index.md>) for transactions, manage records, and connect devices to the internet.

*"Besides supporting and simplifying most of the use cases in traditional Web 2.0, NLWeb creates a plethora of potential new use cases, from paperless international travel, to navigation on underground metropolitan stations. This democratization of ambient computing allows users to chat with nearly anything, from buildings to books and coffee machines, in a personalized, contextually-aware, and unobtrusive way."* - Sam Patel, Global Internet Study.

NLWeb takes the recent developments on agentic AI and applies them to the vision of a new decentralized Web 3.0, giving back to users the control over when interactions start and stop, where their data [resides](<../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/20 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 UI/24 ✅ 🗄️ Vaults/03 ✅ 🗄️🎭 Vault role.md>), which data is [shared](<../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/20 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 UI/25 ✅ 💼 Consumers/04 ✅ 💼🎭 Consumer role.md>), and how they [pay](<../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/30 ⏳ 🫥 Agents/04 ✅ 💳 Payers/01 ✅ 💳🫥 Payer agent.md>). The distributed nature of NLWeb removes the dependency from any single organization, nation, or distributed ledger - nonetheless, Octan is committed to work with all major cloud providers, nations, and organizations to help them and their constituents onboard in a sovereign and compliant fashion.

*"Our customers want to accelerate the return of investment in GenAI, but they've been facing numerous challenges. These include LLM accuracy and guardrails, data [residency](<../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/30 ⏳ 🫥 Agents/01 ✅ 📦 Storage/01 ✅ 📦🫥 Storage agent.md>) and [retention](<../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/20 ✅ 🧑‍🦰 UI/23 ✅ 💬 Chats/04 ✅ 🤗💬 Host chats.md>), third-party agentic AI [discovery](<../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/40 ✅ 👥 Domains/44 ✅ 📜 Manifests/01 ✅ 📜 Domain Manifest.md>) and [integration](<../4 ⏳ ⚙️ Solution/40 ✅ 👥 Domains/41 ✅ 📨 Comms/01 ✅ 📨 Domain Message.md>), streamlining click-to-pay, and resourcing of frontend and mobile developers. NLWeb reinvents the way we address these challenges while leveraging ubiquitous technologies, allowing us to easily enable and onboard organizations."* - Alex Silva, Global Consultancy.

To support organizations upgrading from Web 2.0 to NLWeb, Octan released the NLWeb open-source stack - an SDK for businesses to deploy NLWeb compatible services in the cloud, currently supporting AWS only. For end-users to browse the NLWeb, Octan released also an NLWeb open-source wallet – a chat app available for Android and iOS. The wallet uses a set of default NLWeb agentic AI services managed by Octan - these services are publicly accessible by any organization running on any cloud provider, allowing the community to bootstrap while NLWeb matures.
